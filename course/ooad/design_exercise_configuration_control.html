<h2 align="center">Configuration
Control</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This application is a configuration control system: A file system, and a user
interface above it, that enables many people to work together on a software
project. For each file, several versions are kept. Different users have
different views on the file system (that is, they see different versions of the
same files), but once a user's view is defined, s/he sees a regular file system
and can do any normal operation on files. Editing files requires checkout and checkin
operations. The file system itself is distributed: While a central database
stores data about the users, views and file descriptions, the files themselves
are stored on the many computers of the system's users.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support user management: Adding, editing and removing users,
      defining user groups, and assigning users to groups, and restricting user
      access to various operations (inserting files, changing ownership, adding
      users, etc.).<!--msthemelist--></td>

    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support adding a file into the configuration control
      database; the inserted version of the file is named &quot;base&quot;
      (except the file name, every version has a name). The inserting user
      determine the initial owner of the file, who has the right to change
      access privileges to it.<!--msthemelist--></td>

  <!--msthemelist--><tr>

    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall protect file privileges at a level similar to Unix:
      read/write/execute access can be defined separately for user/group/world.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall prevent editing (writing) files that are in configuration
      control. When a user wishes to edit a version of the file, s/he must
      perform a checkout operation on that version (notice that you checkout a
      version, not all versions of the file). If successful, s/he can write the
      file, and no other user may checkout this version (that is, this version
      of the file is locked).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">When
      a user finishes editing the file, s/he performs one of two operations -
      checkin and &quot;undo checkout&quot;. In a checkin operation, a new
      version of the file is created. The user who performs the operation names
      the new version. This also removes the lock from the version that was
      checked out. In an &quot;undo checkout&quot; operation, the lock from the
      version that was checked out is removed, but no new version is created.<!--msthemelist--></td>

  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support all the above operations - add to configuration
      control, checkout, checkin, undo checkout - on directories as well as
      files. Directories store files and directories inside them; for example,
      adding a file, deleting a file or renaming a file requires checking out
      its directory.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support distributed storage of files and version. While data
      about users, files and versions may be stored in a single central server,
      the data files themselves must be stored on the personal computers of the
      users in the network. The system must be able to locate where in the
      network some version of a file is stored, and ask the operating system to
      send it to another computer. Note that the same user can work in different
      computers from time to time.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable each user to define a view of the files and
      directories under configuration control, and edit this view dynamically. A
      view defines which files and directories the user sees at all, and which
      version of the file is seen. A user can request to see the latest
      checked-in version, or a specific version name. If a user checked out a
      version, s/he can only see the checked-out version.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support view private files. Private files are files or
      directories that are inside controlled directories, but have not being
      added to configuration control. Only the user that created them can see
      them (from any computer in the network). Such files can be edited freely
      (no checkout operation), and they have no versions (no checkin operation)
      - they are regular files, and no operation on them changes controlled
      files (adding/renaming/deleting them does not require checking out their
      directory, for example).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the create, delete, rename, copy and move operations
      on all files and directories, both controlled and private. Creating a file
      creates a private file. All other operations only affect the version of
      the file that the user currently sees.<!--msthemelist--></td>

<p>Each of these ten requirements are worth 10% of the grade on the exercise.
Note that the grade of a single requirement is composed of how you dealt with it
everywhere - in requirements, design, strong and weak spots, and the oral
questions.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
