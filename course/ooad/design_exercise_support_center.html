<h2 align="center">Support
Center</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This application manages the logging and correction of faults reported by
users and machines of a large distributed system. Users may report errors
through forms in their application, but errors may be reported from software
agents as well. Errors arrive at a support center, where the support people
solve these problems. Support managers need the ability to query the status of
errors and assign errors to people who must solve them; people need information
about the error to be able to support it. The system also supports programming
scripts that filter errors, and that automatically respond to common errors.
Since the supervised application can never be shut down, all administration of
the support system must be done at runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<p>These are the requirements from the supervising software agents:</p>

<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable dynamically defining a large set of supervised
      entities. An entity can be a computer, a router, an executable, a network
      connection, a process, a service or a user. Entities are supervised by an
      agent (a software process) running on their computer.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall include agents able to communicate with the application
      through a well-defined API. Agents can be dynamically configured to expect
      several kinds of reports from the application, add other system
      information (such as CPU use, list of running processes, current user,
      current time and so forth) to the report, and send it to a central
      database. Each error report includes, among other things, the category of
      error (use interface, network, etc.) and a level of severity (annoying,
      urgent, critical, etc.).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable dynamically configuring agents to monitor different
      variables of the system periodically, and send reports if these variables
      exceed certain bounds. For example, an agent can be configured to check
      virtual memory levels every minute, and send an error report if free
      virtual memory is below 5% for more than five minutes. Agents must be
      available for many operating systems, so that the variables that may be
      checked are different for different agents.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table>

<p>These are the requirements from the support center application:</p>

<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall include a support center application (user interface), which
      enables all supporters (people who work in the support center) to view,
      investigate and fix errors. It is possible to add, edit and delete users,
      and set different access privileges (which entities and errors are
      visible, which actions are allowed) to each user.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>

    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable a user to dynamically define queries which determines
      which errors to show him. Queries can be on any field of the error (time,
      severity, entity type, etc.), and can be complex (include 'and', 'or',
      'not' conditions). It is possible to query on entity-specific fields (such
      as 'programming language', only available for 'executable' entities).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall allow a supporter to view several queries on different
      windows of her/his screen at once. Whenever the central database changes
      (an error is created or fixed) in a manner that changes queries at
      someone's screen, the screen shall reflect this immediately. That is, the
      refresh should be always active and automatic.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>

    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable certain users to be defined as managers for a specific
      category. Managers are able to assign errors in their category to other
      supporters which must fix them. They also need queries and reports about
      what the supporters that work for them do, what is the status of errors
      they assigned (received / assigned / fixed / unfixed), and at what time
      status changes occurred (how long it takes to fix different kinds of
      problems).<!--msthemelist--></td>

    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall allow supporters to perform several operations on a
      supervised entity remotely: Reboot a machine, reload a router, change
      network or OS settings somewhere, change user permissions, or take over a
      machine. Note that different operations are possible on different entity
      types; also, not all supporters have privileges to perform all operations.<!--msthemelist--></td>

    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the dynamic definition of filtering rules for new
      errors. This is meant to ensure that if a router collapses, the supporters
      won't get 200 errors from all computers and processes that use it. A
      filtering rule is of the form &quot;if between X and Y errors that answer
      the condition &lt;SOME COMPLEX CONDITION&gt; arrive in a &lt;TIME&gt;
      period, convert them into a single error &lt;WITH THESE
      PROPERTIES&gt;&quot;.<!--msthemelist--></td>

    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the dynamic definition of scripts that automatically
      handle common types of errors. It is possible to define that a script is
      executed every time an error which answers to some (complex) condition is
      created. The scripting language will be able to query the error's
      properties, do all operations that a user can do, and support 'if', 'for',
      'while' construct as well as calls to other scripts.<!--msthemelist--></td>

<p>Each of these ten requirements are worth 10% of the grade on the exercise.
Note that the grade of a single requirement is composed of how you dealt with it
everywhere - in requirements, design, strong and weak spots, and the oral
questions.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
