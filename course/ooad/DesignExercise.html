<h1 align="center">The
Design Exercise</h1>
<h3 align="left">The
Goals</h3>
<p align="left">The first
mini-project aims to give you experience in the analysis and <b>design of a
small yet real-world application</b>. As all real-world systems, this includes
dealing with incomplete specifications, unexpected interactions between
requirements, multiple platforms and unforeseeable future changes. Also, it is
impossible to create a &quot;design only&quot; exercise: Knowledge of
algorithms, communications, operating systems and data structures will also be
required to complete the exercises. There is more than one &quot;correct&quot;
solutions for each project, so your creativity, and your ability to explain your
ideas simply, will be tested as well. It is time to sum up your knowledge in
computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3 align="left">The
Problems</h3>
<p align="left">You will
work on <b>one of six problems</b> offered below; you may also offer your own
by email, but offers must be challenging enough to be accepted. Since only three
groups are allowed to work on the same project, request to work on a subject by
sending David an <b>email with your two top requested problems</b>. Projects
will be given to groups on a FCFS basis; if your top choice is taken, you'll be
given your second one. You'll receive email notification of the subject on which
you will work.</p>
<p align="left">These are the offered problems:</p>

<h3 align="left">The
Report</h3>
<p align="left">You should
submit a <b>written detailed design </b>of the problem you are working on.</p>
<p align="left">Start with a detailed description of the <b>requirements of the
application</b>. This includes both the exercise description and your additions
to it. Focus on how you chose to implement general requirements (for example,
what exactly &quot;support dynamic changes of cache behavior&quot; meant for
you), and how you handled interactions between requirements (for example, how do
you undo a command sent over the web?).</p>
<p align="left">You may choose to implement some requirements simply, and others
with many improvements and options. You must implement all the requirements in
the problem specification, but feel free to add your own ideas. The more
sophisticated the implemented requirements, the higher your grade.</p>
<p align="left">Then, <b>For each requirement</b>, explain your design solution:
<b>Class diagrams</b> to understand its structure, <b>sequence diagrams</b> to
understand how the objects interact, and <b>plain text</b> to explain what is
not clear from the diagrams. In short, use whatever you need to clearly explain
how you implement the requirement.</p>
<p align="left">The explanations should be <b>low-level</b> ones, at the level
of detail similar to what we have done in class. This should include which
object calls what method when, in which objects data is stored, time and memory
complexity and so on. When using a <b>design pattern</b> - and you should use
plenty - it suffices to just say to use the pattern for a specific problem, and
no further explanations or diagrams are required. However, be sure that you use
the pattern exactly as-is and don't need some <b>variant</b> of it. If you need
to slightly change a pattern to match your needs, it is enough to shortly explain
where the change is.</p>
<p align="left">All problems require the use of some <b>algorithms and data
structures</b> to solve. You are expected to find these, explain where they are
coded and how they are used inside your design. Designing algorithms in part of
the work - explain the data structures and algorithms you use, except if you use
well-known ones in which mentioning their names is enough (for example, running
a typological search over a directed graph).</p>
<p align="left">Plan your design to be <b>version 1.0</b> of the application.
This means that you should invest most of your effort in designing, and less in
algorithms and data structures. For example, if you need to design a scheduler,
don't use a complex priority + fairness + customizable scheduling algorithm
which uses a complex internal table. Instead, use simple round-robin scheduling,
but make it to be very easy to write new scheduling algorithms, change
schedulers at runtime or activate multiple schedulers together. This is what a
good version 1.0 needs: Get a finished, working product as soon as possible,
release it to the market, and then start working on improvements for version
2.0.</p>
<p align="left">After the designs, your report should list the <b>areas in which
your design is very well prepared to change</b> - places in which it is very
easy to add or change algorithms, support new tools, port to another platform or
operating system, and so on. The more flexible the design, the higher the grade.
Then list <b>changes which will be very difficult to implement </b>with your
design. This should not count against you - every design has them, and you
should be able to identify them. Explain why you chose not to invest time in
dealing with these changes.</p>
<p align="left">Finally, include a <b>short summary</b>, containing your major
personal lessons for this exercise.</p>

<h3 align="left">Submission</h3>

<p align="left">You may work either alone on in a <b>pair</b>. Groups of three
will not be allowed. Pairs are encouraged, since working alone will not mean
making a smaller project. Also, you would benefit a lot from discussing your
ideas with someone else before writing them down.</p>
<p align="left"><b>Do not cooperate with other pairs</b> working on your
subject. The works of teams working on similar subjects will be checked
together, and suspicions of joint work will result in a much lower grade. Two
teams working separately on a design problem will usually reach a very different
solution, and this is what is expected. Remember that this exercise is half the
grade of the entire course - this explains its size and required effort, and the
fact that copying work here will be considered as severe as copying in a test.</p>
<p align="left">The exercise can only be <b>submitted electronically via email</b>
to David. You can submit files in Word, HTML, Visio, Rose or the common graphics
formats. <b>The deadline is midnight of Sunday, January 7th, 2001</b>.</p>
<h3 align="left">Grading</h3>
<p align="left">The
exercise's grade will be combined of 80% for reading the submitted work, and 20%
for <b>answering oral questions</b> about your design choices. The oral
questions are aimed to clarify unclear parts of the written work, and to see
whether you considered other possible designs, and why you decided not to use
them.</p>

<h3 align="center">Good
Luck!</h3>
