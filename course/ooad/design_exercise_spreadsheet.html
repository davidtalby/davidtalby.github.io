<h2 align="center">Spreadsheet</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This application is a spreadsheet: Each file is a matrix of cells, and each
cell can contain either data in some format, or a formula which relies on the
values of other cells. To analyze data, the program supports different kinds of
graphs, goal-finding algorithms and scripting.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support editing multiple spreadsheets in a multiple window
      user interface. A spreadsheet document is a matrix of cells, identified by
      a letter (column number) and number (row number).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support these data types in cells: Integers, real numbers,
      strings, dates and formulas. A formula is a computed expression whose
      value depends on other cells, either in the current or other spreadsheet
      files. Defining a circle of dependencies is illegal, and should be caught
      and reported to the user.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">Formulas
      can include arithmetic operators, functions on numbers, strings and dates,
      and calling scripts that return values (see below). Errors in formulas
      (division by zero, illegal cell reference, unknown function, etc.) are
      caught while typing the formula, and the user will not be allowed to
      finish editing the cell before correcting the error.&nbsp;&nbsp;<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support immediate refresh of computed cells. When the user
      edits a cell, all cells whose value depend on it automatically update. If
      an error occurred during the computation (for example, a division by
      zero), all dependent cells must be marked with a special error display as
      well. The refresh must be efficient: only computation required to display
      the cells on the screen is allowed.&nbsp;<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support each cell having a font, color, size and display
      format. The display format of a cell determines whether it is shown as a
      formula or the value of the formula, a fixed real number or a currency,
      and so forth.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the copy, paste, find, and conditional fill/format
      (changing all cells that satisfy some value) operations, on any or all of
      the formula, value or the display settings of a dynamically defined set of
      cells. For example, a user can request to add 5% to all selected cells
      that contain a non-negative value and are displayed in bold.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall include a goal-finding feature. Such an algorithm tries to
      find what should the value of a given input cell be so that the value of
      another given cell will reach a desired value. For example, a user can
      compute what should the interest rate be so that s/he will have an annual
      profit of 1$ million. The goal finding feature need only work on numbers,
      but it should be easy to change its algorithm or extend it in the
      future.&nbsp;<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">That
      system shall enable writing scripts, either ones that return a value (and
      can be used as functions in formulas), or ones that perform an action (and
      can be used in the program's menus). A script is a list of actions that
      may define variables, call API functions or other scripts, and support
      &quot;if&quot;, &quot;for&quot; and &quot;while&quot; constructs.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support plotting a dynamically selected set of cells as a
      chart (that opens as a new screen on the window). If a chart is on the
      screen, then it must immediately update when the data it depends on
      updates. Many types of charts are supported; the user can also program new
      chart types by writing a script that calls the &quot;Chart API&quot;.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support fast and efficient undo and redo of any command, at a
      depth limited only by the computer's memory.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>

<p>Each of these ten requirements are worth 10% of the grade on the exercise.
Note that the grade of a single requirement is composed of how you dealt with it
everywhere - in requirements, design, strong and weak spots, and the oral
questions.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
