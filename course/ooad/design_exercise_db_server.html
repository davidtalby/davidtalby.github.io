<h2 align="center">Database
Server</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This application is a database server: It receives SQL-like commands over the
network, executes them and sends a response. The server supports nested
transactions. To be efficient, the server supports caching, threading, indices,
automatic normalization and stored procedures. It must provide 24x7
availability, therefore even adding support for new network protocols can be done
dynamically.</p>

<h3>Requirements</h3>

<!--msthemelist--><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support simple versions of the CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE and
      DROP TABLE commands. A table contains several fields, each having a name,
      a data types and a default value. A subset of the fields must be defined
      as the primary key.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the CREATE/DROP CONSTRAINT commands, in a syntax
      which only allows defining a functional dependency. Automatic
      normalization of tables is activated whenever such a command is executed.
      If a table is normalized into several ones, the user must not be aware of
      this. Note that the primary key also defines a functional constraint.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE commands to edit
      records in a table or a view. Their syntax is similar to SQL. (Be careful
      and explicit about how you handle views).<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the BEGIN TRANSACTION, COMMIT and ROLLBACK commands.
      Nested transactions are supported - that is, a BEGIN TRANSACTION inside an
      already started transaction starts a sub-transaction, which can be
      committed or aborted independently of its parent.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the SELECT statement, with the DISTINCT, FROM, WHERE,
      GROUP BY, HAVING and ORDER BY options. Sub-selects and functions are not
      supported at the moment, but will be in a future version. Provide a simple
      algorithm that parses a SELECT statement and returns the result, and
      prepare for a future smarter algorithm.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the CREATE/DROP INDEX commands. A created index of a
      field in a table must always be kept updated. Provide a simple algorithm
      that uses indexes to answer queries, and prepare for a future smarter
      algorithm.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support the CREATE/DROP PROCEDURE commands, which define
      stored procedures. A stored procedure is a list of other commands,
      possibly procedures, which optimize a set of database accesses into one to
      optimize network usage. The CALL command activates a stored procedure.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall support receiving commands from the network in a variety of
      protocols. The server receives only text commands, but may answer with
      either a data table or a status of success or failure. The server can be
      dynamically configured to support new network protocols.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall enable processing many transactions and queries in parallel.
      Locks must be placed to protect tables that are written by two concurrent
      transactions. Deadlocks must be detected and handled.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
  <!--msthemelist--><tr>
    <!--msthemelist--><td valign="baseline" width="42"><img src="neoabul1.gif" width="15" height="15" hspace="13"></td>
    <td valign="top" width="100%">The
      system shall include a cache of recently used tables, indices, procedures
      and query results. The cache must be aware of the fact that it includes
      data on which many different ongoing transactions work in parallel. It
      should be easy to configure the cache by an administrator at runtime to
      use different caching algorithms.<!--msthemelist--></td>
  </tr>
<!--msthemelist--></table>

<p>Each of these ten requirements are worth 10% of the grade on the exercise.
Note that the grade of a single requirement is composed of how you dealt with it
everywhere - in requirements, design, strong and weak spots, and the oral
questions.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
