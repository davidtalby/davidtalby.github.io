Setup and Basics</strong></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong><br>
    </strong><strong><u>Setting Up Your Account</u></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Copy the Oracle default
    configuration file from db's home directory to your home
    directory:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><code>cp ~db/prefs.ora
        .</code></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Then, if you are registered
    to the course, you should be able to enter SQL interactive
    mode. To do this, type:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><code>sqlplus /</code></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Once inside, you can type SQL
    queries and see their answer at once. You can also type </font><em>exit</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> to leave SQL interactive, or </font><em>help</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> to get help on the language and
    environment.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The first thing you should do
    is run the example database creation file of exercise 3:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><code>sqlplus /
        &lt; ~db/animals.sql</code></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This will read and run the
    file ~db/animals.sql - you'll see the output of the sql
    commands in the file on your screen. The file creates the
    five tables used in the exercise, and also inserts demo
    values into these tables. Feel free to change these tables (read
    animals.sql to see how simply this can be done), so that you
    can test your queries on cases that the demo tables don't
    cover.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The easiest way to write and
    test complex SQL queries is not the interactive way; instead,
    write a text file and give it as input to Oracle. This will
    make SQL run the commands/queries in the file input.sql, and
    write the output to the file output.sql:</font></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><code>sqlplus /
        &lt; input.sql &gt; output.sql</code></font></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">You are expected to submit
    printed input and output files with every exercise. Document
    your queries well - lines started with a semicolon are
    treated as comments in an SQL file.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    </font><strong><u>Basic SQL Queries</u></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">All queries are expressed
    with the </font><em>select </em><font face="Times New Roman">keyword.
    The basic form is select-from-where which translates to
    &quot;do a cartesian product of what the </font><em>from </em><font
    face="Times New Roman">says, the do a selection according to
    the what the </font><em>where </em><font
    face="Times New Roman">says, then do a projection to what the
    </font><em>select </em><font face="Times New Roman">says&quot;.
    All SQL commands are case insensitive (that is, SELECT and
    select are the same word), and are terminated by a semicolon.</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Print the names and subjects
    of research projects:<br>
    </font>select name, subject from research;<font
    face="Times New Roman"><br>
    Print all fields of the animals table: <br>
    select * from animals;<br>
    Print all the species of animals we have, but only print each
    species once:<br>
    select distinct species from animals;<br>
    Print countries which offer sites with a humid climate:<br>
    select distinct country from sites where climate = 'humid';<br>
    Print the cartesian product of sites and events:<br>
    select * from sites, events;<br>
    Print the natural join of projects and events:<br>
    select projects.pid, name, subject, aid, sid, year from
    projects, events where projects.pid = sites.pid;<br>
    Print pairs of projects that have the same subject:<br>
    select p1.pid, p2.pid from projects p1, projects p2 where p1.subject
    = p2.subject;<br>
    Print animals and their age:<br>
    select aid, 1999 - birthyear from animals;<br>
    Print animals and their age. Only print animals older than
    ten years:<br>
    select aid, 1999 - birthyear age from animals where age &gt;
    10;</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    </font><strong><u>Aggregate Queries</u></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The following queries
    calculate the average, minimum and maxium sizes of sites:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select avg(size), min(size),
    max(size) from sites;</font></p>
    <p>These calculate the number of lines in the animals table,
    the number of lines with non-null species field, and the
    number of distinct species in the table:</p>
    <p>select count(*), count(species), count(distinct species)
    from animals;</p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">These are called aggregate
    queries, because they take many values (all sizes) and
    aggregate (summarize) it to one value (for example, the
    average).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><br>
    </font><strong><u>Not So Basic Predicates</u></strong></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">This section discusses things
    you can do in a </font><em>where </em><font
    face="Times New Roman">clause. The most basic things are
    testing for equality using = &lt;&gt; or for ordering using
    &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= and </font><em>between</em><font
    face="Times New Roman">. You can also use </font><em>not</em><font
    face="Times New Roman">, </font><em>and</em><font
    face="Times New Roman">, </font><em>or</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> to create complex conditions. The
    following is a simple example (note that no parentheses are
    needed):</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from animals where
    size &gt;= 10 and birthyear &lt;= 1998 and not species = 'Whale';<br>
    select * from sites where size between 10 and 20 and climate
    &lt;&gt; 'desert';</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The </font><em>in</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> and </font><em>not in</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> predicate returns true if a value is
    in a given set. You can specify the set directly or using a
    sub-select like here:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from sites where
    country not in ('Japan', 'Papua New Guinea', 'Taiwan');<br>
    select * from animals where aid in (select parent from
    children);</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">The exists and not exists
    predicates get a table, and return true if and only if the
    table is not empty:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from sites where
    exists (select * from events where sid = sites.sid);</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">There's no 'forall' predicate,
    so such queries have to be translated from 'for all x, P(x)'
    to 'not exists x such that not P(x)'. For example:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from animals a1
    where not exists (select * from animals a2 where a1.size &gt;
    a2.size);</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides </font><em>in</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> and </font><em>exists</em><font
    face="Times New Roman"> there are also operators that can
    compare values to a group of other values. These operators
    are composed of a regular comparison operator and either the </font><em>all
    </em><font face="Times New Roman">or </font><em>any </em><font
    face="Times New Roman">keywords:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from animals where
    size &lt;=all (select size from animals);<br>
    select * from animals where size &gt;any (select size from
    animals);<br>
    select sid, name from sites where climate &lt;&gt;all (select
    climate from site where county = 'Norway');</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another useful keyword is
    contains, which tests for exactly what its name suggests:</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">select * from animals a where
    (select sid from events where aid = a.aid and pid = 'p1')
    contains (select sid from events where aid = a.aid and pid =
    'p2');</font></p>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman">Sub-selects can be nested as
    much as you want them to. Most queries can be expressed in
    more than one way, and the most efficient and readable way
    should be chosen.</font></p>
