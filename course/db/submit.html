Register for the course:
</H3>
If you haven't done this already, run <EM>~db/bin/register</EM>

<H3>
<A NAME = "tar">
	Tar File:
</A></H3>

You should create a tar file called exN.tar (where N is the number of
the practical exercise, e.g. ex2.tar for practical exercise no. 2) that contains the files
you should submit, and then submit only the tar file. See <EM>man
tar</EM> for more information.

<H3>
<A NAME = "comp">
	Submitting On The Computer:
</A></H3>

Use <EM>~db/bin/submit N</EM> to submit practical exercise number
N, in the directory that contains the tar file.  For example, to
submit practical exercise 2 type: <EM>~db/bin/submit 2</EM>.<P>

You may submit several times, but only the last submission before the
deadline (of midnight) will be accepted. <P>

For submit to work, make sure that both the submitted file and the directory
that contains it are readable to everybody at the time of submission.
At all other times your files should be closed for reading.

Use <EM>~db/bin/getgrade</EM> to get your grades. 
(BUG : Note the exercise numbering is not set up properly yet.)
