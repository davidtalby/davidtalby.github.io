    <ol>
        <li>You are required to design a database for a car
            rental company. The company has many branches all
            over the world, and customers may pick a car in one
            branch and return it in another. Every car belongs to
            one branch, and until now every branch kept separate
            car lists. Branches are responsible for regular
            maintenance of their cars, and records of accidents,
            periodic treatments and replaced parts should be kept.
            Customers pay either by one of several major credit
            cards or by cash. For every rental, the driver's
            personal information, type and condition of the car,
            insurance information and so on is kept. For private
            customers, the company offers a 'frequent renter'
            program to encourage repeating business. Customers
            that are companies, on the other hand, may enjoy
            bigger and more constant discounts, but do not take
            part in the 'frequent renter' program. Companies can
            also use several insurance companies for the cars
            currently at their disposal, while private customers
            can only use one<font size="3">.<br>
            <br>
            Define the entity sets, relationship types, and their
            relevant properties (not all of which have been
            stated above). Specify keys for each entity set, and
            the functionality (many-to-one, for example) for each
            relationship type. Denote weak entity sets and their
            partial keys. Answer in the form of an E-R diagram,
            and </font>state explicitly any assumptions which you
            have made.</li>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol>
        <li value="2"><font size="3">Attribute domains,
            functional relationships and keys are all forms of <em>constraints</em>
            on the modeled system. Another common form is that of
            participation - stating that each entity of an entity
            set must take part in a relationship that set is
            attached to. This constraint is marked by a double
            line between that entity set and the relationship
            type; for example, the following states that each
            child has exactly one mother, and women may have
            between zero to any number of children:</font></li>

    <blockquote>
        <p><font size="3">Create an E-R model with entity sets
        for workers, departments and projects, and add
        relationship types and constraints to model the following
        rules. Every worker works at exactly one department, and
        every department has some workers. Every project is
        assigned to at least one department, but some projects
        belong to several ones. A department may have many
        projects or no projects at all. Every project also has a
        set of workers assigned to it; every worker has at most
        one project, but not always has one at all. Every worker
        has a supervisor (another worker), except the big boss
        who nobody supervises. Not all workers are also
        supervisors, although some workers supervise many others.</font></p>

        <li value="3">E-R diagrams are useful for modeling, but
            not for implementation - other models can be
            described by efficient data structures and can
            compute queries with known time and space complexity.</li>

            <li>Transform the E-R diagram from question 2 into a
                relational database schema. See last year's
                exercise 1 (on the web) for an example.</li>
