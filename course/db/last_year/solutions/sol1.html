    <p><strong><u>Question 1</u></strong></p>
    <p>Definition of the relations and their attributes (a key is
    marked with an underline):</p>
    <p>&quot;Library&quot; - Name<br>
    &quot;Campus&quot; - Name<br>
    &quot;Student&quot; - ID Number, Name<br>
    &quot;Book&quot; - Number, Name (this is a weak entity set,
    the full key is number + Library.Name)</p>
    <p>Definition of relationships and their type:</p>
    <p>Library &quot;Located in&quot; Campus - Many to one<br>
    Book &quot;Belongs to&quot; Library - Many to one<br>
    Student &quot;Studies in&quot; Campus - Many to many<br>
    Book &quot;Borrowed to&quot; Student - Many to one. This
    relation has attributes: Return date, and 'Through library'
    which contains the library through which the book was
    borrowed, or null if the book was borrowed directly from the
    library that owns the book.<br>
    Student &quot;May Borrow From&quot; Library - Many to many.
    This relation has one attribute 'is Member?', which is true
    if the student is a member of the library, and false if the
    student is not a member but may borrow books from that
    library using inter-library loan.</p>
    <p>Remarks:</p>
    <p>1. Other combinations of relations, like using a triple
    relation &quot;Loan&quot; between Student, Book and Library,
    or using two separate relations to represent the two kinds of
    &quot;May Borrow From&quot;, and allowed as long as they
    contain all of the above information.<br>
    2. Reasonable attributes may be added to relations (Student's
    phone number, etc.).<br>
    3. Each entity set must have a key. Book has to be a weak
    entity set.</p>
    <p>The Diagram:</p>
    <p>1. Check the different kinds of relations (many to one,
    many to many) are described by the proper arrows.<br>
    2. It is not allowed to duplicate relations (as we do in the
    trees model).</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong><u>Question 2</u></strong></p>
    <p>To change the Entity-Relationship diagram into a network
    database schema, we'll translate every relation to an entity
    (with the appropriate attributes and keys). This process will
    get rid of many to many relations as well.</p>
    <p>It is important to give proper keys to the newly created
    entities. Their keys may be composed of more than one
    attribute. Every reasonable representation of the weak entity
    set is acceptable; a reasonable representation is one that
    doesn't lose information.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Question 3</u></strong></p>
    <p>Because neither tirgool nor class explained exactly how to
    write the relational database schema, every readable listing
    of tables and their attributes, so that each entity from the
    network schema becomes a table with the same attributes, is
    acceptable.<br>
    We disregard keys completely here. No points will be taken
    off for anything that has to do with keys in this question.<br>
    Two possible ways to write the relational database schema:<br>
    1. R1 = { Students } S1 = (ID Number, Name)<br>
    2. Students(ID Number, Name)</p>
    <p>The translation of this exercise's database the a
    relational database schema, using the second style:</p>
    <p>Student (ID Number, Name)<br>
    Campus (Name)<br>
    Library (Name)<br>
    Book (Name, Library)<br>
    Studies in (Student.ID Number, Campus.Name)<br>
    Belongs to (Book.Number, Library.Name)<br>
    Located in (Library.Name, Campus.Name)<br>
    May Borrow From (Student.ID Number, Library.Name, is Member?)<br>
    Loaned to (Student.ID Number, Book.Library, Book.Name, Return
    Date, Through Library)</p>
