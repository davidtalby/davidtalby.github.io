        <p><strong>The Example Database Schema:</strong>
        Suppliers supply certain parts for certain projects. The
        information about who supplies what to which projects is
        found in the shipments table. The tables are:</p>
        <p>Suppliers(s#,sname,status,city)<br>
        Parts(p#,pname,color,weight,city)<br>
        Projects(j#,jname,city)<br>
        Shipments(s#,p#,j#)</p>
        <p>The s#,p#,j# attributes are key attributes. The tables
        are available to query using Oracle.</p>
        <p><strong>Express the following queries in tuple
        relational calculus and SQL:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Get all pairs of part numbers that are supplied
                by the same supplier. Include both pairs (a,b)
                and (b,a) in your answer.</li>
            <li>Which part numbers are heavier than p1?</li>
            <li>Which projects (give project numbers) are made
                entirely out of red parts?</li>
            <li>For which colors are all the parts of that color
                supplied by s5?</li>
            <li>What are the names of the projects which are
                located in a city where no supplier is located?</li>
            <li>Get supplier numbers for suppliers who supply the
                same part to all projects.</li>
            <li>What are the average, minimum and maximum values
                for supplier status?</li>
            <li>What is the average number of parts per project?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The queries should be clearly documented! For
        questions 7 and 8 only an SQL query is required.</p>
        <p><strong>You should submit:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first six queries in calculus, on paper.</li>
            <li>Printouts of the eight SQL queries and outputs.</li>
            <li>Submit electronically (run ~db/bin/submit to
                submit <u>ex1.tar</u>) the following files:<br>
                <u>README</u> - containing only your login on the
                first line, and your full name and relevant
                exercise documentation afterwards.<br>
                <u>queries.sql</u> - containing the queries.<br>
                <u>outputs.txt</u> - containing the outputs.</li>
        </ul>
