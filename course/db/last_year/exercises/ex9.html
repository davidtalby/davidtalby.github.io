    <p><strong>The Example Database Schema:</strong> A
    manufacturing firm buys basic parts and builds composite
    parts out of them. There is a cost to every basic part, and a
    cost to assembling a composite part out of all its basic
    parts (which doesn't include the cost of the basic
    components). Composite parts may be composed from other
    composite parts as well. The information about parts is
    stored in the Base_Parts and Composite_Parts tables, and the
    Made_From relation specifies which and how many basic parts
    each composite part needs. Made_from(car, wheel, 4) indicates
    that a car is made using four wheels.</p>
    <p>Base_Parts (pno, cost)<br>
    Composite_Parts (pno, assembly_cost)<br>
    Made_From (pno1, pno2, qty)</p>
    <p>Standard assumptions can be made about the database:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No part number appears both in Base_Parts and
            Composite_Parts.</li>
        <li>'pno' is a key for Base_Parts and for
            Composite_Parts.</li>
        <li>'pno1' and 'pno2' together form a key for Made_From.</li>
        <li>All part numbers in Made_From appear in either
            Base_Parts or Composite_Parts.</li>
        <li>The graph corresponding to Made_From is acyclic, but
            it is <u>not</u> necessarily a tree. This means that
            we might have, for example:<br>
            Made_From(car, wheel, 4), Made_From(bike, wheel, 2),
            Made_From(wheel, tire, 1), ...</li>
        <li>All basic parts have no children in the graph.</li>
        <li>All composite parts have at least one child in the
            graph.</li>
        <li>Some of the new parts (both base and composite) have
            been inserted into the database without a cost,
            because it is still under negotiation. Therefore,
            there may be null values in the cost field of these
            tables.</li>
        <li>No composite part is composed of basic or composite
            parts with null values.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Write a C program with embedded SQL statements to
    do the following:</strong></p>
    <p>You should compute the relation <u>Costs(pno, total_cost)</u>,
    where total_cost is the total cost for making part pno -
    including the costs of all the base parts and the costs of
    assembling the composite parts. This relation should contain
    a record for every part (both basic and composite). The Costs
    table should be created as a new table - pno is of type
    varchar(15) and total_cost is of type number(10). These are
    also the types that are used by the existing tables. Your
    program should create and fill the Costs table, print it to
    the screen, and destroy it.</p>
    <p>Your should use a reasonable amount of main memory space,
    since the above relations can be very large. You may use
    tables to store intermediate results. Tuples containing null
    values should be ignored - such parts needn't be used in your
    computations, and shouldn't appear in the final Costs table.</p>
    <p>The input size of this problem is the total number of
    parts n. Your algorithm should use at most O(log n) queries.
    Every SELECT statement counts as one query; when using
    cursors, every time you OPEN the cursor it counts as one
    query.</p>
    <p>When encountering any type of error you should print a
    detailed message to the standard error stream, and terminate
    the program emmidiately with an error code 1. If the program
    ends without an error, it should return an error code 0.</p>
    <p>Your program should be <em>superbly</em> documented. Your
    README file, along with the usual information, must also
    include the pseudo-code for the algorithm you use, and an
    analysis of the number of queries it performs.</p>
    <p><strong>You should submit:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Submit electronically (run ~db/bin/submit to submit <u>ex4.tar</u>)
            the following files:<br>
            <u>README</u> - containing only your login on the
            first line, and your full name and relevant exercise
            documentation afterwards. Specifically, this include
            the pseudo-code and run-time analysis of the
            algorithm you use.<br>
            <u>Makefile</u> - When running 'gmake', exactly one
            executable named 'ex4' should be created.<br>
            <u>ex4.out</u> - An example output of your program,
            on the example Oracle database.<br>
            <u>ex4.pc</u> - The program's source code.<br>
            If you have more source files, specify their names in
            the README file.</li>
        <li>Submit printouts of everything, except the Makefile,
            to the course's submission box.</li>
    </ul>
