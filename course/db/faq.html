I get this error when trying to drop the table 'costs':<br>
  resource busy and acquire with NOWAIT specified<br>
I cannot execute the program now, since 'costs' already exists.
how can i drop the table?

<p>
This is what can happen when you do not exit properly from Oracle
e.g. if the xterminal is turned off while you're in a session, or if
you have a process in the backgound in an infinite loop connected to the
database.<br>
Your sessions have to be killed to solve this ...

When trying to run "sqlplus" on a unix shell, it responded:<br>
"sqlplus: Command not found."<br>

This was checked by me and another user. I checked it right after a new login.
The time is now 15:40.

<p>
The reason is that grotto went down (the database server runs on grotto).<br>
In to check if grotto is down or up type:<br><br>

/usr/etc/ping<br><br>
If grotto is ok you should get an answer that looks something like this:<br>
grotto.cs.huji.ac.il is alive

How can we connect a menu to a form, or a form to a menu?


Open your form file with the Forms40. Choose in the menu the 'Form'
item and in the sub-menu that will appear choose the 'Module' item.
The proper sheet of the Forms module will appear. One of the properties
that you have to specify is the 'Menu Module' property. Write the name of
your menu's executable file (for example lib_menu.mmx).

I tried to copy the demo named "chess.fmb" in "/CS/oracle/forms40/demo", and
compile it. I've got an error message: cannot find library /chess.
How can I run any example which combines a from with a menu, and have the code
of it (*.fmb, *.mmb), to look at? 

<p>

The demo ttrig.fmb compiles with no problems.
Another (fun) demo to look at is in
  /cs/oracle/tools/demo
It uses Oracle forms, reports, book and graphics and is quite involved.
Read the README.txt for more info.
The source and executables are both there (no need to compile).

<p>
Instructions on compiling and running the demos can be found in
/cs/oracle/forms40/doc/relnotes.doc   chapter 5 <br>
note : use your own database account and not scott/tiger<br>
       use f40runm, f40genm ,... and not f40run,...<br>
UNFORTUNATELY : the chess form can not be run (the instructions
given do not work - a problem with attaching the library)
However, the other demos seem to be fine (I tried out the cafe
demo and it works).
