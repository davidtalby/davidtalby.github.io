    <p><strong><u>Question 1</u></strong></p>
    <p>The entity sets, relationship sets, attributes, keys and
    multiplicity of relationships are all defined in the diagram.
    The attributes given here are just examples - you may define
    other attributes, as long as you define a key for every
    entity set and store all the information explicitly mentioned
    in the exercise (type of payment, for example). Note that
    every entity set appears only once, in contrast with the
    network model.</p>
    <p>The given solution is not the only correct one, of course.
    For example, it assumes that 'Car' is a weak entity set,
    identified by its license number and branch name. Cars
    obviously cannot be identified by license number only, since
    cars from different countries may have the same number, but
    you can add the country as an attribute to 'Car' and define {
    License number, Car } to be its key. The 'Belongs To'
    relationship will still exist then, but as a regular one.
    Another choice that has to be made is how to represent the 'Rental'
    relationship: Here, it is a relationship between four entity
    sets, defining the renting customer, the car, the branch from
    which the car was taken, and the branch to which it returned.
    The start and end dates of the renting are attributes of the
    relationship, which is many-to-many-to-many-to-many (can you
    tell why?). Customers are divided to private ones, for which
    a milage is kept for the frequent renter program, and
    companies, which may use more than one insurance company at
    once.</p>

    <p><strong><u>Question 2</u></strong></p>
    <p>Some students divided 'Worker' to 'Regular' and 'Big Boss'
    using an is-a relationship, in order to express the fact that
    all regular workers are supervised. This is a nice extension,
    but the following diagram qualifies as a correct and simpler
    solution. Attributes have been removed for clarity.</p>
    <p align="center"><img src="ex1_q2.GIF" width="500"
    height="255"></p>
    <p><strong><u>Question 3</u></strong></p>
    <p>There are two possible ways to write the relational
    database schema:<br>
    1. R1 = { Students } S1 = (ID Number, Name)<br>
    2. Students(ID Number, Name)</p>
    <p>We will use the second, shorter, style:</p>
    <p>Worker (ID Number, Last Name, First Name, Job, Supervisor,
    Department, Project)<br>
    Department (Name, Location, Phone)<br>
    Project (Name, Description, StartDate, EndDate)<br>
    Projects_Departments (Department_Name, Project_Name)</p>
    <p>What happens to constraints after the translation?
    Attribute domains are kept in the relational model. The
    miltiplicity (many-to-one, etc.) constraints are also kept -
    it is visible from the translated schema that every worker
    may have at most one project, while every project can belong
    to many departments. Keys are not kept by the list of
    relations, and for now they're lost - although they'll be
    back with a vengeance in a later part of the course.
    Participation constraints are not kept: There is no way of
    saying that every project should have at least one entry in
    the Projects_Departments relation.</p>
    <p>One delicate point in the translation is the supervisor
    attribute in worker, which is only valid if the model also
    supports null values - that is, values that say &quot;nothing
    is stored here&quot;, meaning &quot;this worker has no
    supervisor&quot;. If you assume that null values don't exist
    in the relational model than you have to create a relation
    Supervising(Worker ID, Supervisor ID) to store this data -
    but then, you can't be sure that every worker is assigned at
    most one supervisor.</p>
