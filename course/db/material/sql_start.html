<blockquote>
    <p><strong><u>Setting Up Your Account</u></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>First, edit your <font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><code>.cshrc</code></font>
    file, by appending the file <font size="4"
    face="Times New Roman"><code>~db/oracle-cshrc</code></font>
    to the end of it. Then, copy the Oracle default configuration
    file from db's home directory to your home directory:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>cp ~db/prefs.ora ~</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Afterwards, logout and log back in. If you are registered
    to the course, you should now be able to enter SQL
    interactive mode. To do this, type:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>sqlplus /</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Once inside, you can type SQL queries and see their answer
    at once. You can also type <em>exit</em> to leave SQL
    interactive, or <em>help</em> to get help on the language and
    environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The first thing you should do is run the example database
    creation file of exercise 3:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>sqlplus / &lt; ~db/animals.sql</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This will read and run the file ~db/animals.sql - you'll
    see the output of the SQL commands in the file on your screen.
    The file creates the five tables used in the exercise, and
    also inserts demo values into these tables. Feel free to
    change these tables (read animals.sql to see how simply this
    can be done), so that you can test your queries on cases that
    the demo tables don't cover.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The easiest way to write and test complex SQL queries is
    not the interactive way; instead, write a text file and give
    it as input to Oracle. This will make SQL run the commands/queries
    in the file input.sql, and write the output to the file
    output.sql:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>sqlplus / &lt; input.sql &gt; output.sql</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>You are expected to submit printed input and output files
    with every exercise. Document your queries well - lines
    starting with '--' and /* */ blocks are treated as comments
    in an SQL file.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    <strong><u>Basic SQL </u></strong><b><u>Queries</u></b></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>All queries are expressed with the <em>select </em>keyword.
    The basic form is select-from-where which translates to
    &quot;do a cartesian product of what the <em>from </em>says,
    the do a selection according to the what the <em>where </em>says,
    then do a projection to what the <em>select </em>says&quot;.
    All SQL commands are case insensitive (that is, SELECT and
    select are the same word), and are terminated by a semicolon.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Print the names and subjects of research projects:<br>
    <code>select name, subject from research;<br>
    </code>Print all fields of the animals table: <br>
    <code>select * from animals;<br>
    </code>Print all the species of animals we have, but only
    print each species once:<br>
    <code>select distinct species from animals;<br>
    </code>Print countries which offer sites with a humid climate:<br>
    <code>select distinct country from sites where climate = 'humid';<br>
    </code>Print the cartesian product of sites and events:<br>
    <code>select * from sites, events;<br>
    </code>Print the natural join (except that <code>pid</code>
    is printed twice) of projects and events:<br>
    <code>select * from research, events where research.pid =
    events.pid;<br>
    </code>Print pairs of projects that have the same subject:<br>
    <code>select p1.pid, p2.pid from research r1, research r2
    where r1.subject = r2.subject;<br>
    </code>Print animals and their age:<br>
    <code>select aid, 1999 - birthyear from animals;<br>
    </code>Print animals and their age. Only print animals older
    than ten years:<br>
    <code>select aid, 1999 - birthyear age from animals where age
    &gt; 10;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    <strong><u>Aggregate </u></strong><b><u>Queries</u></b></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The following queries calculate the average, minimum and
    maxium sizes of sites:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select avg(size), min(size), max(size) from sites;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These calculate the number of lines in the animals table,
    the number of lines with non-null species field, and the
    number of distinct species in the table:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select count(*), count(species), count(distinct
    species) from animals;</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>These are called aggregate queries, because they take many
    values (all sizes) and aggregate (summarize) it to one value
    (for example, the average).</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><br>
    <strong><u>Not So Basic </u></strong><b><u>Predicates</u></b></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>This section discusses things you can do in a <em>where </em>clause.
    The most basic things are testing for equality using =
    &lt;&gt; or for ordering using &gt; &lt; &gt;= &lt;= and <em>between</em>.
    You can also use <em>not</em>, <em>and</em>, <em>or</em> to
    create complex conditions. Here is a simple example (note
    that no parentheses are needed):</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from animals where size &gt;= 100 and not
    species = 'Whale';<br>
    select * from sites where size between 10 and 20 and climate
    &lt;&gt; 'desert';</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <em>in</em> and <em>not in</em> predicate returns true
    if a value is in a given set. You can specify the set
    directly or using a sub-select like here:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from sites where country not in ('Japan', 'China',
    'Taiwan');<br>
    select * from animals where aid in (select parent from
    children);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>The <i>exists</i> and <i>not exists</i> predicates get a
    table, and return true if and only if the table isn't empty:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from sites<br>
    where exists (select * from events where sid = sites.sid);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>There's no 'forall' predicate, so such queries have to be
    translated from 'for all x, P(x)' to 'not exists x such that
    not P(x)'. For example:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from animals a1<br>
    where not exists (select * from animals a2 where a1.size &gt;
    a2.size);</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Besides <em>in</em> and <em>exists</em> there are also
    operators that can compare values to a group of other values.
    These operators are composed of a comparison operator and
    either the <em>all </em>or <em>any </em>keywords:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from animals where size &lt;=all (select
    size from animals);<br>
    select * from animals where size &gt;any (select size from
    animals);<br>
    select sid, name from sites<br>
    where climate &lt;&gt;all (select climate from site where
    county = 'USA');</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Another useful keyword is contains, which tests for
    exactly what its name suggests:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p><code>select * from animals a where<br>
    (select sid from events where aid = a.aid and pid = 'p1')
    contains<br>
    (select sid from events where aid = a.aid and pid = 'p2');</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Sub-selects can be nested as much as you want them to.
    Most queries can be expressed in more than one way, and the
    most efficient and readable way should be chosen.</p>
