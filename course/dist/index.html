<h1 align="center">Distributed
Algorithms</h1>

<p>Most interesting computer systems today, as well as those of the future, are
distributed in nature: the Internet, cellular and PDA communications, biological
and bio-tech computations,&nbsp; international trade, multi-national corporate
databases, multi-user games, and even your LAN at work. Developing
software for such complex systems requires an understanding of basic algorithms
that these systems use, and the ability to develop and adjust new algorithms
under changing conditions. This is our goal.</p>
<p>The material has been divided to two courses; Syllabus I will be given in the
fall semester, and Syllabus II will be given in the spring semester. The courses
are independent: you can take any one without taking the other, or decide to
take both.</p>

 Bibliography</h3>

<p align="left">Our book:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
      <p align="left">Distributed Algorithms, by Nancy
      Lynch&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

      <p align="left">If you intend to take both courses or just love this area,
      seriously consider buying this book. It is a large encyclopedia of
      distributed algorithms, and can be useful as a reference book in your
      future.

 Exercises &amp; Grading</h3>
<p align="left">The
course will be graded by a final test (70%), as well as two exercises (15%
each), which must be
submitted and can be done in pairs.</p>
<p align="left">Since this is a last-year elective course, exercises have a more
advanced format: They will involve learning and explaining an algorithm from the
book on your own. Preferably at most two pairs will work on the same problem.
Each exercise must be printed, 4-10 pages long, and include the following
sections: The problem description, the algorithm description, an informal
correctness argument, an example execution of the algorithm, complexity
analysis, special notes (termination, useful variants, etc.), and practical uses
of the algorithm.</p>
<p align="left">Dividing algorithms to student pairs will be done in class.
Submit exercises by emailing them to David by midnight of the submission date.
Hand-written exercises will not be accepted.</p>
<p align="left">Grades for the first semester's course are available <a href="grades.html">here</a>.</p>
