In this exercise you will:
<ul>
<li>Design the first version of a ZIP file manager and extractor</li>
<li>Produce a set of UML class and sequence diagrams to document your design</li>
<li>Experience design patterns in actual  Java code</li>
<li>Write a covering set of unit tests</li>
<li>Experience working with Eclipse, JUnit and Ant</li>
</ul>

<h4>Requirements</h4>

<p>Create an executable named <code>xzip</code> which is able to print and 
extract the contents of ZIP files.
The program's usage from the command line should be:</p>
<p><code>xzip [-l | -s | -x] [-nr] &lt;zip file name&gt;</code></p>
<p dir="ltr">Note that the first two parameters are optional, but the file name 
is not. Parameters must appear in this order.</p>
<p>A zip file can contain files, which may be compressed (but don't have to be). 
In addition, a zip file can also contain directories, which may by themselves 
contain files and other directories. When a zip file is extracted, the 
directories it contains are extracted as well, and files within these 
directories are extracted to their correct relative location.</p>

<p>For the examples given below, assume that the zip file <code>my.zip</code> 
contains the following: A file called <code>mysong.mp3</code> which is an MP3 
song, a file called <code>myicon.gif</code> which is a GIF image, and a 
directory called '<code>web</code>' which includes two HTML files called <code>
index.html</code> and <code>other.html </code>and one directory called <code>
backup </code>
file which includes two other files with these same names.</p>

<p>The first argument of <code>xzip</code> dictates what action will be 
performed on the zip file:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-l</code> (long print): This action prints the names and details of 
the files stored in the given zip file. The long format means that in addition 
to the file names, more details are printed for each file. For example:<br>
<br>
<code>&gt; java xzip -l my.zip</code><br>
<code>mysong.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7901 bytes, MP3 
file)<br>
myicon.gif&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (910 bytes, 32x32 GIF 
image)<br>
web&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(directory, total 5 files)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index.html&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(5657 bytes, 122 lines of text)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; other.html&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(6983 bytes, 208 lines of text)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; backup&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(directory, total 2 files)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index.html&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(5622 bytes, 120 lines of text)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other.html&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
(7501 bytes, 234 lines of text)<br>
</code><br>
As you can see, the details printed for each file type are different, and follow 
these rules:<br>
<code>1. </code>For each text file, the name of the file is printed, followed by 
a tab, and then the text <code>(N bytes, M lines of text) </code>where <code>N</code> 
is the uncompressed size of the file, and <code>M</code> is the number of lines 
(measured by the number of new-line characters) in the file. A text file is 
defined as any file whose extension is <code>*.txt</code>, <code>*.html</code> 
or <code>*.java</code>.<br>
<code>2. </code>For each image file, the name of the file is printed, followed 
by a tab, and then the text <code>(N bytes, WxH EXT image)</code> where <code>N</code> 
is the uncompressed size of the file, <code>W</code> is the image's width, <code>
H</code> is the image's height, and <code>EXT</code> is the image file extension 
in uppercase. An image file is defined as any file whose extension is <code>
*.gif</code> or <code>*.jpg</code>.<br>
<code>3. </code>For any other file type - any regular file not a text or zip file, 
such as <code>mysong.mp3</code> and <code>backup.zip</code> in the above example - print the file name, a 
tab, and the text <code>(N bytes, EXT file)</code> where <code>N</code> is the 
size of the uncompressed file and <code>EXT</code> is the file extension in 
uppercase.<code><br>
4. </code>For each directory, the name of the directory is printed, 
followed by a tab, and then the text <code>(directory, total N files)</code> where
<code>N</code> is the number of files in that directory. Each  directory that the directory contains 
is counted as one (for the directory itself) plus the number of files inside 
that directory, recursively. In addition, as the example above shows, the 
contents of the directory are printed in the following lines, under the same 
rules, with an indent of three spaces relative to the indent of the directory.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>-s</code> (short print): This action prints the names of the files and 
directories in the given zip files, but without the extra details (file size, 
number of text lines and so forth) which the long format provides. Printing is 
equivalent to what the <code>-l</code> option outputs, including indentation and 
recursion into directories and zip files - only the text in parentheses for each 
file/directory is not printed. For example:<br>
<br>
<code>&gt; java xzip -s my.zip</code><br>
<code>mysong.mp3<br>
myicon.gif<br>
web<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; index.html<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; other.html<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; backup<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; index.html<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; other.html<br>
</code>&nbsp;</li>
<li><code>-x</code> (extract): This action actually extracts the contents of the 
zip file into the file system. That is, for each file/directory in the zip file, 
a new uncompressed file/directory should be created in the file system. Files 
should be created in the current directory, but files that are inside 
directories in the zip file should be created inside these relative directories 
in the file system. If a file is being extracted and another file with the same 
name already exists, then the existing file should be overwritten.<br>
Upon completion, this action prints one line to the console in this format:
<code>Extracted N files, M files failed</code>. <code>N</code> is the total 
number of&nbsp; files and directories that were successfully created, and <code>
M</code> is the total number of files and directories that failed. In addition, 
one line is printed for each failed file or directory, including a detailed 
error message. Whenever possible, an error should not result in halting the 
entire program, and the program should output the error message and continue 
normally. For example:<br>
<br>
<code>&gt; java xzip -x my.zip<br>
Error: Failed to extract myicon.gif: Cannot overwrite existing file - file is in 
use<br>
Extracted 7 files, 1 files failed</code><br>
<br>
And the reported 7 successful files will be the following (locations are 
relative to the current directory):<br>
<code>mysong.mp3</code><br>
<code>web\<br>
web\index.html<br>
web\other.html<br>
web\backup\<br>
web\backup\index.html<br>
web\backup\other.html</code></li>
</ul>

<p>The second command-line argument of <code>xzip</code> means &quot;no recursion&quot;, 
and if it appears then all actions should be performed without recursion into 
directories. This means that only one summary line is printed for every 
directory in the printing actions, and that the directory is created but not 
populated in the extract action. For example:</p>

<p>
  <code>&gt; java xzip -l -nr my.zip</code><br>
  <code>mysong.mp3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (7901 bytes, MP3 
  file)<br>
myicon.gif&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (910 bytes, 32x32 GIF 
image)<br>
web&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  (directory, total 5 files)<br>
  <br>
  &gt; java xzip -x -rn my.zip<br>
  Extracted 3 files, 0 files failed<br>
  <br>
  </code>In this example, the 3 extracted files will be<code> mysong.mp3, myicon.gif </code>
  and <code> web\.</code></p>
<p>The default action is <code>-l</code>, meaning that <code>xzip my.zip</code> is equivalent to <code>
xzip -l  my.zip</code>. You should print an informative usage message if the 
program is activated with no or illegal command-line arguments. You should print 
a detailed error messages and exit gracefully when a critical error occurs (the 
given zip file does not exist, the given zip file is corrupted and so on).</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
While this exercise can be  programmed within a single class, this won't work since this
<code>xzip</code> is only a first version, so it is crucial to maintain an open mind with
respect to possible future requirements. Consider the following:<ol>
<li>It may be required to be able to read input format other than ZIP, such 
as TAR, ARJ, CAB and other archive file formats. The input does not even have to 
be a file: It can be the set of files of a given directory, a given FTP server 
address and so forth.</li>
<li>It may be required to support other file types that the long print action provides 
additional details about. For example, printing the image size for image files 
such as <code>myicon.gif</code>, or printing the song duration for music files 
such as <code>mysong.mp3</code>.</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It may be required to produce the output in formats other than 
plain text - HTML, PDF, Word or
    others. It may also be required to write output in several formats at once, for example:<br>
    <code>xzip  -pdf myzipfiles.pdf -html myzipcontents.html my.zip</code>.</li>
<li>It may be required to modify the input zip file instead of just printing or 
extracting it. For example, new actions may enable adding files and directories to the zip 
file,  changing the date and time signature of zipped files, and so on.</li>
<li>It may be required to support recursion into zip files, and not only into 
directories. For example, if a zip file contains another zip file, then its 
contents would have to be printed (recursively) like a directory's contents are 
printed, and when a file is extracted any zip files it contains would be 
extracted as well.</li>
<li>It may be required to activate all of the program's features not only from 
the command-line, but also from a graphical user interface, or perhaps even two 
user interfaces (for example, one that is a custom UI for handling zip files, 
and another which is fully integrated with the Windows Explorer).</li>
</ol>
You must design your program so that it is easy to add code that implements the above requirements.
Assume that you are the one who will actually have to code it - that's how it usually is in "real life".
For each of the above requirements write an explanation in your README file, not more than three
sentences long, which explains how it should be coded. For example:

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr"><b>Requirement:</b> It may be required to define filters on which files  get
printed or extracted, in addition to the <code>-nr</code> switch. For example, new 
command-line arguments can dictate that only text files should be acted on, only 
files that match a given pattern (such as <code>*.cpp</code>), and so on.</p>
<p><b>Solution:</b> Write an Iterator for each kind of filter, whose next() method will move to the
next element for which the filter is true. Such iterators are implemented as Decorators of other
iterators, which easily enables to dynamically combine different filters and does not require
changing or recompiling existing code.</p>
</blockquote>
It is important that each solution you present will be at most three sentences long. The intention is
to enforce the use of design patterns vocabulary rather than elaborating specific class and object
relationships.<h4>Code & Unit Test</h4>

<p dir="ltr">This exercise intends you to divide your time equally between actual coding and between design,
writing UML diagrams, and answering the above six design questions.  With a proper design, this
exercise is quick and simple to code. You are required to write in Java 5.0, and you 
may use the standard libraries to
their full extent - the standard streams, strings and data structures. In 
particular, working with zip files is done using the <code>java.util.zip</code> 
package, and working with image files is done using the<code>
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/javax/swing/ImageIcon.html">javax.swing.ImageIcon</a></code> class (see references and code samples below).</p>

<p dir="ltr">You are also required to use the Eclipse environment for this 
exercise, and are encouraged to take advantage of its editing and debugging 
features to their full extent. Submit the Eclipse project file together with 
your exercise, so that it would be possible to open your project and read your 
code, UML diagrams and Ant file within Eclipse. The UML diagrams should be done 
using the Omondo UML plugin (see the <a href="../help.html">Technical Help</a> 
page for details on installing it at home). You are required to provide class 
diagrams that include all your classes; there may be more than one diagram, if 
this is visually easier. You are also required to provide at least two sequence 
diagrams, depicting two interactions in your design which you consider 
important.</p>

<p dir="ltr">It is also required that you submit unit tests to test your work, 
and use the JUnit framework to do so. Organize your unit tests into classes by 
subject, and write a method for each small test. Organize the code such that the 
program source code is in one package (for example <code>xzip</code>), and the 
tests are in a separate package (for example <code>xziptest</code>). Each test 
should be self-validating - that is, know by itself whether it has passed or 
failed. Writing unit tests should be an integral part of coding: This is 
essential when code must be changed in newer versions. We recommend that you try 
test-first programming - read the <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/unittests.html">following article</a> 
as a starting point - and in any case you will lose time if you only write all unit tests 
after you &quot;finish&quot; coding. You will have another chance to estimate the 
convenience of unit tests in exercise 3.<p>One metric for measuring the usefulness of a set of unit tests is called coverage, which means
the percentage of your code that the unit tests actually run. Coverage of 90% or above is
considered good, and you should aim to that goal.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The code you submit must be built with no compiler warnings, and pass all unit tests. 
You must submit an Ant file (<code>build.xml</code>) with your exercise, whose 
default target compiles the entire program, and runs all unit tests.</p>

<p>This is an advanced course, so there is no intention to take points for coding style or
naming conventions - the emphasis is on proper design. However, you are as always expected
to write clear code with a consistent style.</p>
