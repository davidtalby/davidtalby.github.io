</ul>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Create a Java Swing application named <code>ixzip</code> which is able to 
print and extract the contents of ZIP files and directories, and synchronize 
them.
The program's usage from the command line is <code>ixzip [views]</code>, where
<code>views</code> is an optional number between 2 and 9, with a default value 
of 3. The program opens a window which contains one text box for entering user 
commands, one &quot;Ok&quot; button for executing the entered command, one label to 
display messages about the last action performed, and a set of views (whose 
number is determined by the <code>views </code>command-line argument), which can 
contain multiple lines of text.</p>

<h4>Viewing Directories and ZIP Files</h4>

<p>The views are numbered 1 to 9 from left to right. The following commands are 
used to open and display views:</p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>open</b> N <b>as</b> [directory or zip file] -</code> This 
command opens the given zip file or directory, and prints its contents inside 
view number <code>N</code>. Printing is done exactly as done in <code>xzip</code> 
from exercise 1. A directory and its files are printed exactly as if they were a 
zip file with the same name containing the same files.<br>
On success, the text &quot;<code>opened [directory/zip file name] in view N</code>&quot; 
should appear in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>close</b> N - </code>This command closes view number <code>
N</code>, clearing its display, and canceling any previous <code>copy</code> or
<code>sync</code> commands in which it is mentioned (these two commands will be 
explained below). When the program starts, all views are closed.<br>
On success, the text &quot;<code>closed view N</code>&quot; should appear in the message 
bar.<br>
Calling <code>close</code> on a view that is already closed is legal. Calling
<code>open</code> on an already open view is legal, and is equivalent to closing 
that view and then reopening it. For example, the following two sequences of 
commands are equivalent:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 1 as c:\web&nbsp; ;&nbsp; close 1&nbsp; ;&nbsp; 
open 1 as d:\my.zip<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 1 as c:\web&nbsp; ;&nbsp; open 1 as d:\my.zip
</code></p>
  </li>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>display &lt;short/long&gt; - </b></code>This command toggles 
whether views are displayed in short or long format, as defined for the <code>-s</code> 
and <code>-l</code> command-line arguments of <code>xzip</code> respectively. 
Executing this command changes the display of all open views to reflect the new 
setting immidiately. When the program start, short display is active.<br>
On success, the text &quot;<code>[short/long] display is active</code>&quot; should appear 
in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In case of error, the message bar should contained an informative message 
describing it. Quitting the program is done by pressing the X button on its 
window's upper right corner, and this naturally closes all views.</p>

<h4>Copying and Synchronizing Views</h4>

<p dir="ltr">The main function of <code>ixzip</code> is not to display zip files 
and directories, but rather to make copies and synchronize them. Selecting what 
will be copied where is done using the <code>copy</code> command<code><b>:</b></code></p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>copy X to Y </b>-<b> </b></code>Select all the files and 
directories (recursively) in view number <code>X</code> to be copied into view 
number <code>Y</code>. If the same file name already exists in view <code>Y</code>, 
it will be overwritten. The display of view <code>Y</code> should be immediately 
modified to reflect how it will appear after the copy operation. Each file or 
directory that will be copied from a different view should prefix its name with 
that view number in parentheses.<br>
On success, the text <code>Marked view X to be copied to view Y</code> should 
appear in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For example, assume that the following views have been opened:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p dir="ltr">Then after executing the command <code>copy 1 to 2</code>, the 
display will be as follows:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>(1) one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    (1) two.txt<br>
    (1) others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The order of printed files in each view may be different in your program, 
since the printing order of files within a directory is undefined. Note that the
<code>copy</code> command only marks files to be copied - actually making the 
copy is only done via the <code>commit</code> command, as the next section will 
explain. There are two special rules regarding the <code>copy</code> command:</p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>Rule of transitivity</b> - </code>The command <code>copy X 
to Y</code> marks for copying not only the actual files of view <code>X</code>, 
but also any other files or directories that are already marked to be copied 
into it. Other views that are copied from view <code>Y</code> need to be updated 
according to this rule as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">For example, after executing the command <code>copy 2 to 3</code> 
in the previous example, the display will show:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>(1) one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    (1) two.txt<br>
    (1) others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>(1) one.txt<br>
    (2) four.txt<br>
    (1) two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) three.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p dir="ltr">The second part of the rule of transitivity means that the order of
<code>copy</code> commands doesn't matter: Executing <code>copy A to B</code> 
and then <code>copy B to C</code> has the same effect as executing <code>copy B 
to C</code> and then <code>copy A to B</code>. In the above example, the display 
would look the same if we executed <code>copy 2 to 3</code> first and <code>copy 
1 to 2</code> afterwards.</p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>Rule of cycles</b> - </code>Whenever a <code>copy X to Y</code> 
command causes a cycle to be created between two or more views, then for every 
file that exists in more than one of these views, the most up-to-date file (as 
dictated by its last modification time) should be copied to all these views. If 
two versions have the exact same last modification time, then the version from 
the smallest view number should be copied to all these views.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">For example, assume that the most up-to-date version of <code>
one.txt</code> is in the directory or zip file displayed in view 1, that the 
most recent version of <code>four.txt</code> is in view 2, and that the most 
recent version of <code>others</code> is in view 3. Then, after executing the 
command <code>copy 3 to 1</code> on the above table, the display will show the 
following:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    (2) four.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    (3) others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>(1) one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    (1) two.txt<br>
    (3) others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>(1) one.txt<br>
    (2) four.txt<br>
    (1) two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) three.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p dir="ltr">The rule of cycles preserves the property that the order of <code>
copy</code> commands executed on a set of views doesn't matter, even when cycles 
are created. Calling <code>copy X to Y</code> after <code>X</code> is already 
copied to <code>Y</code> through some cycle (for example, calling <code>copy 1 
to 3</code> on the above table) is legal, and similarly calling <code>copy X to Y</code> twice is legal. Note that whenever a 
cycle occurs, the list of files and directories as well as the source view for 
each file will be the same in all views participating in the cycle. This has the 
effect of synchronizing all the views in the cycle, and to make this common 
operation easier for users, the following command is defined:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>sync X and Y</b> - </code>This command is equivalent to 
the two commands <code>copy X to Y</code> and then <code>copy Y to X</code>.<br>
On success, the text <code>Marked views X and Y to be synchronized</code> should 
appear in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Whenever a view is closed, all <code>copy</code> and <code>sync</code> 
operations involving it are discarded. For example, the following sequence of 
commands:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 1 as c:\web<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 2 as d:\web.zip<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 3 as e:\backups\web<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy 1 to 2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy 2 to 3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy 3 to 1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; close 2<br>
</code>Is equivalent to this series of commands:<br>
<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 1 as c:\web<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open 3 as e:\backups\web<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy 3 to 1</code></p>

<h4 dir="ltr">Commit and Rollback</h4>

<p dir="ltr">While <code>copy</code> and <code>sync</code> enable a user to mark 
files and directories for copying and view the results, actual changes to the 
file system are only caused by this command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>commit</b> - </code>This command performs all the marked 
copies in the actual file system. This can involve directory to directory, 
directory to zip file, zip file to directory or zip file to zip file transfers. 
After this operation all views should be refreshed, and all the previous <code>
copy/sync</code> commands are discarded.<br>
On success, the text <code>Copy operations were committed</code> should appear 
in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">For example, after executing <code>commit</code> on the display 
from the end of the previous section, files will be copied and then the display 
will show:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>The user can also decide not to perform actual copying of the marked files, 
using this command:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><code><b>rollback</b> - </code>This command discards all previous
<code>copy/sync</code> commands, and refreshes all views. This is equivalent to 
closing and reopening all views in a single command.<br>
On success, the text <code>Copy operations were rolled back</code> should appear 
in the message bar.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">For example, after executing <code>rollback</code> on the display 
from the end of the previous section, no files will be copied and the display 
will show:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>1</code></b></td>
    <td width="33%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>2</code></b></td>
    <td width="34%" align="center">
    <p dir="ltr"><b><code>3</code></b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td width="33%">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    two.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; three.txt</code></td>
    <td width="33%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt</code></td>
    <td width="34%" valign="top">
    <p dir="ltr"><code>one.txt<br>
    four.txt<br>
    others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; five.txt</code></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h4 dir="ltr">Undo and Redo</h4>

<p dir="ltr">The last two commands that <code>ixzip</code> should support are 
the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>

<p dir="ltr"><b><code>undo</code></b> - Undo the last command. The <code>open</code>,
<code>close</code>, <code>copy</code>, <code>sync</code> and <code>display</code> 
commands can be undone, and the result of undoing them should restore the 
program to its exact state before the command was executed. On success, the text
<code>Command [command name] was undone</code> should appear in the message bar. 
The <code>commit</code> and <code>rollback</code> commands cannot be undone, and 
trying to undo them should result in an informative error message. The user can 
undo an unlimited number of commands - that is, the entire history of commands 
since program startup or the last <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code> 
command should be kept.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><code>redo</code></b> - Redo the last command that was undone; or in 
  other words, undo the last <code>undo</code> operation. This command can only 
  be called if command preceding it was <code>undo</code>; if <code>undo</code> 
  was called multiple times, then <code>redo</code> can be called multiple times 
  as well to redo all these <code>undo</code> commands. On success, the message 
  bar should contain the text of the relevant command that was redone.</li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">As an example, the following table demonstrates a list of commands, 
and the text that should appear in the message bar after each command:</p>
<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%">
  <tr>
    <td width="36%"><i>Command:</i></td>

    <td width="64%"><code>Error: No commands to undo</code></td>
  </tr>

<h4 dir="ltr">Performance and Testing Considerations</h4>

<p>Although ixzip is an interactive program supporting at most nine views, in 
its next version the same code is planned to be used as a synchronization 
server, and will be required to handle up to thousands of concurrent 
synchronizing client directories and zip files. This has two implications. 
First, you should design this program as a performance-critical application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The time required to handle a <code>copy/sync</code> command must be 
  proportional to the number of involved views, and not to the number of all 
  views. Iterating over all views is unacceptable.</li>
  <li>The time required to handle a <code>commit</code> command must be 
  proportional to the number of files and directories being copied, and not to 
  the total number of files and directories in the open views.</li>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">Saving on memory is important as well: Zip files should be 
extracted to memory only when it is necessary to do so, and not immediately when 
a zip file is opened into a view.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p dir="ltr">Second, you should make it easy to reuse as much of the program's 
code as possible in a different executable that will not have a Swing user 
interface:</p>
<ul>
  <li dir="ltr">

<p dir="ltr">Maintain a very clear separation between the Swing user interface 
class(es) and all other program code. The Swing layer should be as thin as 
possible, and should be encapsulated in a separate Java package.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Such a separation is important in every application that contains a graphical 
user interface for another reason: unit testing. Note that it is impossible to 
directly unit-test a GUI, since you have no way to replace the human using the 
keyboard and mouse. Unit tests only work on objects, and so you must maintain 
the amount of code that you don't unit test (and only test manually, in this 
exercise) to an absolute minimum.</p>
<h4>Design</h4>
<p>Answer the following questions about your design, in one or two paragraphs at 
most:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Explain how your code is divided into packages, and what is the 
  dependencies graph between packages. Explain the rationale behind this 
  division.</li>
  <li>Explain how your design handles a <code>copy/sync</code> command in a time 
  that is proportional to the number of involved views, and not to the number of 
  all views.</li>
  <li>Explain how your design handles a <code>commit</code> command in a time 
  that is proportional to the number of files and directories being copied, and 
  not to the total number of files and directories in the open views.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then, for each of the following possible future requirements from <code>ixzip</code>, 
explain in 2-3 sentences how your design can be easily extended to implement 
them.</p>

<ol start="4">
  <li>It may be required to add a <code>recursion &lt;of/off&gt;</code> command, which 
  toggles whether <code>copy</code> and <code>sync</code> commands operate 
  recursively on directories or not. Note that the default, which you must code 
  and test in this exercise, is to copy directories recursively.</li>
  <li>It may be required to support <code>copy/sync</code> of a subset of files 
  from one view to another. For example, a command such as <code>copy *.java 
  from 1 to 2</code> would mean that only <code>*.java</code> files should be 
  copied from view 1 to view 2.</li>
  <li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">It may be required to support other commands on files displayed in 
views, for example to <code>rename</code> a file or directory, <code>delete</code> 
a file or directory, <code>move</code> a file from one view to another and so 
on. Undo and redo functionality may be required for such commands as well.</p>

  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Code & Unit Test</h4>

<p dir="ltr">All the code &amp; unit test guidelines from <a href="ex1.html">
Exercise 1</a> apply to this exercise as well. In addition, you are required to 
use the code base and tests you developed for <code>xzip</code>, and you must 
submit it as well. The submitted code, unit tests, UML diagrams and Ant build 
file should include both <code>xzip</code> and <code>ixzip</code> in full. You 
are allowed to make any changes in your <code>xzip</code> code to make it more 
easily reusable for <code>ixzip</code>, but note that you will have to make sure 
that <code>xzip</code> still works after these changes, and to maintain its unit 
tests as well.</p>

<p>The time and effort required to complete this exercise highly depend on the 
quality of your design. The recommended order in which to think about your 
design is to design the required data structures first, the classes and 
operations that use these data structures second, and the Swing UI and main 
program flow last. Also, think in advance about how to partition your code into 
packages, and provide separate test classes for each package.</p>

Submit a zip file which contains the following:<ul>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">All program source code, for both <code>xzip</code> and <code>
  ixzip</code>.</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">All unit tests source code, for both <code>xzip</code> and <code>
  ixzip</code>.</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">An Ant <code>build.xml</code> file, whose default target compiles 
  and runs all unit tests for both <code>xzip</code> and <code>ixzip</code>.</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">UML diagrams, which should include a package diagram describing 
  the dependencies between all your packages, class diagrams that cover all 
  classes (from both <code>xzip</code> and <code>ixzip</code>), and at least 
  four sequence diagrams (two from <code>xzip</code> and two new ones about 
  important interactions in <code>ixzip</code>).</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">A README file, with the usual contents (IDs, logins and full 
  names, descriptive list of files and features) and answers to the six possible 
  extensions in the design section above. The README file should also describe 
  parts of the design or design choices that are not evident from reading the 
  UML diagrams.</li>
  <li>
  <p dir="ltr">The Eclipse project file, to enable opening your project and 
  reading all of the above files from within Eclipse.</li>
