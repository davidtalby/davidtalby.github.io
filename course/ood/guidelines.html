<dl>
<dt>Teaching Policy</dt>
<dd>We make every effort to help you study the course material in the most 
convenient way for you:</dd>
<dd>
<p dir="ltr">- You are welcome of course to attend the lectures and the 
exercises<br>
- All course material, including lectures, exercise slides and class handouts 
will be available online<br>
- The 'Resources' section contains online papers that cover a large percentage 
of the material and can be used to learn it, as well as any other useful 
material you find<br>
- You are also welcome to schedule meetings at the reception hour for individual 
assistance.<br>
In addition, we firmly believe in learning from hands-on experience, and so an 
important part of the course is the exercises. The five exercises compose 45% of 
the final grade.</dd>
<dd>&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>Programming Exercises</dt>
<dd>
Students in this course are required to submit all homework 
assignments in pairs. Two heads are better than one, especially when designing 
software - but if this causes a problem for you, exceptions can be made. Each pair must work on their own 
- you are assumed to know the distinction between cooperation and cheating.<br>
Programming exercises must be done in Java, using the Eclipse platform. See the 
'Technical Help' section about how to download and install at home Eclipse and 
all the plug-ins we will use. Although this
is not a first-year programming course, points will be taken for messy, unmodular or under-documented code.
Be professional! Your code will not undergo a serious of automatic tests, but it 
will have to pass several tests, as well as rigorous reading of the code and the 
design, in order to assess how good your design is. In addition, each exercise must be accompanied with a complete set on unit tests using JUnit. The unit tests are 
an important part of the exercise! It is
suggested that you  start with the unit tests before writing the actual code.<br>
All programming exercise must include an ant file which performs a complete 
build (compilation and execution of unit tests), and include a README file.<br>
&nbsp;</dd>

<dt>README submission</dt>
<dd>The README file should include the following details:
<ul>
<li>In the first line should be the login(s) of the author(s), comma seperated
(and nothing else).</li>
<li>The personal details of the author(s).</li>
<li>The name of the exercise.</li>
<li>A list of the submitted files, with a one line dexcription for each file.</li>
<li>Any remarks you have about special cases, implementations, additional features
or anything else you think the checker should know.</li>
<li>The name of the file should be "README". Not "readme", "ReadMe"&nbsp; or other 
variations which mainly appear after working under Windows.</li>
</ul>
You can use the <a href="README">sample README</a> as template.</dd>

<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt>Theoretical Exercises</dt>
<dd>
There are three&nbsp; theoretical exercises. They are intended to introduce you 
to further material, which we don't have time to cover in class. Therefore, each 
such exercise usually asks you to read 3-5 articles, and answers questions which 
show that you understand them. As a solution,
submit a file with your answers, which must be in one of the following
formats: text file (.txt), HTML file (.html) or PDF (.pdf).
The name of the file should be exX.&lt;suffix&gt; (i.e. ex1.txt, ex2.pdf). It should contain
the submitters' names, logins and IDs.
</dd>

<!--
<dt>What to submit</dt>
<dd>Each submission has to include a README file whose details are described below.
<ul>
<li><b>Hardware Projects</b> - Submit the *.hdl you wrote.</li>
<li><b>Assembler Projects</b> - Submit the *.asm you wrote.</li>
<li><b>Proggramming Projects</b> - Submit only the source code of the program, as
well as the makefile.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
-->

Note that no printouts are submitted in any exercise in this course.<dt>&nbsp;</dt>

<dt>How to submit</dt>
<dd>The exercises are submitted electronically. For each project create a zip file
called <i>exX.zip</i> (i.e. ex1.zip, ex2.zip, etc). Linux users:
create the file using <code><b>zip -9 -r &lt;zip-file&gt; &lt;file-list&gt;</b></code>.
Submit the zip file using the course admin system that can be reached from the
<a href="admin.html">administratives page</a>.</dd>
<dt>&nbsp;</dt>


<dt>What if you can't finish the exercise on time?</dt>
<dd>Relax. Submit what you have done,  explain what  problems you had to complete
the exercise, and you will get partial credit for your work. Another popular 
approach is to <a href="mailto:ood@cs.huji.ac.il">email us</a> with an excuse we 
can't reject, and an extension request so polite that we can't refuse.</dd>
