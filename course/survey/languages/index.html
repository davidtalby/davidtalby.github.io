<h1 align="center">Languages
Track</h1>
<p align="left">A decade ago,
developers would choose a programming language, write their application's entire
source code, compile it, link it to create an executable on some machine and
operating system, and run it. Today, not one part of this sentence remains fully
correct - code is heavily reused in different programming languages and
platforms, parts of the program are loaded from the web at runtime, programs can
(and do!) fix themselves while running, and linking is often dynamic as well.
This track covers these drastic changes in the way programmers work.</p>

<h3 align="left">1.
CLR and CSharp</h3>
<p align="left">given by Yaron Basson,
Yosi Cohen and Nariman Cohen</p>
<p align="left">Microsoft's Common
Language Runtime in the .NET platform is an ambitious attempt to build a tower
of babylon of all programming languages. Over 30 languages are expected to be
supported. The major development languages for the Windows and .NET platforms
are also new - Visual Basic 7 is very different than its predecesor, and C#
(pronounced C-Sharp) is an all new language. This lectures covers the main
features of the CLR (classes, inheritance, exceptions, threading, garbage
collection, shared libraries, etc.), and an overview of the main features of the
C# programming languages.</p>
<p align="left">One of the demos should be consist of two classes written in C#
which interact using events and properties. The other should show how unmanaged
and managed C++ code in Visual Studio.NET can be combined in a single
executable.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.
Delphi &amp; Kylix</h3>
<p align="left">given by Uzi Chen,
Eliaz Hershkovits and Itamar Cohen</p>
<p align="left">Delphi is a very powerful RAD development environment for
Windows, which improves Visual Basic by providing a better programming language
(based on Object Pascal), and making it much easier to write new user interface
components. Over the last few years, a very large number of smart user interface
components have been written for Delphi, making it today the prime choice for
creating fancy UIs.</p>
<p align="left">Today, Delphi has been ported to Linux in a project called Kylix.
This creates the most advanced development environment on Linux today, making it
far easier to develop fast applications with complex user interfaces, and to
develop Apache-based Internet and database applications. Moreover, libraries
that can be shared between Windows and Linux have been developed, enabling
developers to write code once and compile it to both platforms.</p>
<p align="left">This lecture should cover Delphi's programming language
(classes, inheritance, interfaces, exceptions, etc.), the ability to write
components (how it is coded and used), the CLX library that is shared between
Windows and Linux, and design tips for writing applications that can run on both
platforms.</p>
<p align="left">Of the two demos, one should be a Windows application
demonstrating the use of some freeware Delphi components (from the list below),
and another should either be in Linux (if possible) or demonstrate Delphi's
polymorphic features.&nbsp;</p>

Java 1.0 and 1.1</h3>

<p align="left">given by: Barak Hecht and Shay Amir</p>
<p align="left">The Java language brought into mainstream programming many
features and additions that were considered academic or experimental until them.
It had seem tremendous success thanks to these innovations. This lecture covers
the major features that helped Java gain its initial popularity: The Java
Virtual Machine and Bytecode, the ability to create both applications and
applets, garbage collection, dynamic class loading (and class ClassLoaded),
Reflection, Serialization, the configurable Security Manager, and the java.net.*
class library.</p>
<p align="left">One of the demos of this lecture should show a practical use of
reflection and serialization (and XML object stream, for example), and the other
should be an applet that can present data about a given URL (such as its title
and first few lines).</p>
<p align="left">Everything you need is under &quot;Products &amp; APIs&quot; in
Sun's Java site:&nbsp;</p>

Java 1.2 and 1.3</h3>

<p align="left">given by: <b>Available</b></p>
<p align="left">Java continued to implement very new ideas in programming
languages, and in contrast to many other such attempts, they are widely used all
over the world. This lecture covers the major additions in the 1.2 and 1.3
revisions of the JDK, relying on the standard edition of the platform (J2SE).
The topics covered are: Java Beans, the Collections Framework, dynamic proxy
classes, reference objects, Swing, the accessibility API, the extensions API and
the plug-in framework.</p>
<p align="left">One of the demos of this lecture should demonstrate a practical
use of dynamic proxy classes, and the other should show a practical use of
reference objects.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Short Lectures of this Track</b></p>
<p align="left">The short lectures present languages that dominate specific
niches of the industry.</p>

<h3 align="left">1.
Python</h3>

<p align="left">given by Ilan Peer and Noam Galon</p>
<p align="left">The successful OO scripting language, its main uses and applications, development
tools, unique features and support for multiple platforms.</p>

<h3 align="left">2.
High Performance Fortran</h3>
<p align="left">given by Dor Sher, Ben
Dvir and Elon Yekutiel</p>
<p align="left">An extension of
Fortran for programming
for super-computers. What it includes, who uses it, and what development tools
are available.</p>

<h3 align="left">3.
Visual Basic . NET</h3>

<p align="left">given by Orli Rosentsvieg and Liran Nir-Shoshan</p>
<p align="left">The important features of this brand new programming language.</p>

<h3 align="left">4.
FoxPro . NET</h3>

<p align="left">given by: <b>Available</b></p>
<p align="left">What FoxPro is, what it is used for, and what features have been
added to it in its new .NET edition.</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Projects of this Track</b></p>
<p align="left">A project in the languages track requires you to learn and
employ some of the more sophisticated features of the discussed languages, in a
way that creates a useful application (not just a useless demo of some weird
features). Projects that combine two programming languages are most welcome. For
example, a project can demonstrate how MIL code allows writing a GUI in VB, an
algorithm in C++ and a data structure in CSharp. Another project can demonstrate
how Java objects can be serialized to XML using Reflection and communicated to
and from Delphi code via sockets. Or, as usual, you can make your own offer.</p>
