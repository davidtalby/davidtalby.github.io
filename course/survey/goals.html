<h1 align="center">The
Goals of The Industrial Survey</h1>

<p align="left">There are three things you will gain from participating in the
Survey.</p>

<h3 align="left">1.
Meet the Industry&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The last few years have been very dense with new technologies and products.
It is hard to tell facts from marketing hype, and it is impossible to know
everything. The goal of this course is to become familiar with the technologies
that are most heavily used in the software industry today, and learn the ones
that are most useful to you. You will know what each buzzword technically means,
for what problems it can and can't help, and what do competing technologies have
to offer.</p>
<p>Since many technologies and products in many areas must be covered, a
preference was given to covering as many topics as possible instead of going
into depth on few ones. Besides listening to lectures on all topics, each pair
of students will self-study three different topics from three different areas during
the course. A full course can be given on any of the presented topics, so the
only goal is to give enough information so that you will know what is worth
specializing in when the same problems will rise in your future work.</p>

<h3>2. Gain Hands-On
Experience</h3>

<p>You will also gain practical experience on the topics that interest you.
First, all lectures must include a full demonstration of using the technology,
and focus on technical implementation data rather than listing features. After
all, you need to know how to code, compile and install a PalmPilot application -
it's not enough to know that it's possible. Second, the written online reports
must include such demonstrations, so that people will be able to self-learn the
products and ideas at home or work after the lecture. And third, part of the
course's grade is a practical programming project, which gives you hands-on
experience on a topic of your choice.</p>
<p>Building a good practical project can service you well in job interviews, and
maybe even evolve into the final project of your degree.</p>

<h3>3. Improve in
Public Speaking</h3>

<p>You will improve your ability to prepare a presentation and lecture in front
of people. You should take this course, but if you're afraid of public speak
then you must take this course. Next year, at work, your career will depend on
your ability to present ideas and convince: Explaining a clever design to your
team members, convincing your boss to support your new project, working with
customers or getting people to invest in your startup all require talking
skills. When people say that you don't learn the most important skills for
success in college, this is it.</p>
<p>The Survey can help you improve. You will gain experience in summarizing
material and creating convincing presentations; you will gain feedback for your
performance as well as others; and you will listen to others learn from their
feedback as well. You can also ask for close guidance in preparing your lectures
from David.</p>
<p>You're too old to give in to your fears and miss what this course has to
offer just to avoid speaking in public. Your career depends on it from now on,
whether you like it or not. Better practice now, while you're still among friends.</p>
