<h1 align="center">The
Design of The Industrial Survey</h1>

<p align="left">One of the major
goals of Hadassah college is to prepare its students to the real world - to give
students practical experience in current tools and technologies, in equilibrium
with providing theoretical tools for tomorrow's challenges. Many students also
expressed hopes for more courses on widely used industrial technologies: MFC,
ASP, EJB, COM and others. We wanted to build a course that answers those requests,
and prepares you better for work.</p>
<p align="left">My name is David Talby. I have a masters degree in computer
science and an MBA in business, both from the Hebrew University. I am currently
serving in the air force, part of a very large project using many of the
technologies and tools covered in the Survey. I've been teaching several
advanced courses in Hadassah for four years. This page describes my
considerations in building &quot;The Industrial Survey&quot; course the way it
is; hopefully, after reading it you'll be convinced that you should take this
course - regardless of what your interests are, what your experience is, and
what you'd like to be doing in the next few years. This course is the first one
in Hadassah designed explicitly to answer students' needs.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The first issue </b>to deal with in building the course was
that there is an enormous variety of popular technologies and tools in the
market today. Many of these technologies complement each other, but many compete
with each other - guessing which one will survive would be a bet on students'
futures. The problem is worse because usually technologies don't &quot;win&quot;
or &quot;lose&quot; but continue to exist side by side for many years, and
different companies work with different tools. Why teach everyone ActiveX, when
half the people will work with Servlets? Why limit you in the choice of a
workplace? What if you already have a workplace which uses one technology?</p>
<p align="left">So even at first, I was skeptic about focusing on one
technology.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The second issue </b>to handle was that many
&quot;technologies&quot; are a combination of tools, concepts, methodologies,
and other technologies. Sometimes they are just new names for old ideas,
invented to increase someone's sales. Many times companies throw wild
accusations at their competitors, and it is hard to tell facts from emotion.
Does EJB replace CORBA or live side by side with it? Is dot-NET the end of COM?
What does this all mean?</p>
<p align="left">We, as software engineers, don't care much about marketing hype.
What is important to us is the bottom line - how does the code look like, how
each new technology makes writing projects easier and safer, what is the
performance of each competitor, and how to technically connect it to other tools
we're using. It is crucial to know the technical facts behind different
buzzwords. Much more important&nbsp; than knowing how to write a Java applet,
you need to know the difference between Applets, Servlets, JavaScripts, ASP
pages, ActiveX controls, XSL producing DHTML, EJB beans, COM+ components and
dot-Net services. In your next project, you'll need to choose between them. So
first know what they are, then know which one is best for you; the last thing to
do is start studying one of them in depth.</p>
<p align="left">So, I decided that the course won't focus on one technology, but
will present a variety of technologies, with an emphasis on surveying competing
solutions from different companies.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The third issue </b>to overcome was that different students
wanted to study different things. Some students wanted an intensive course on
MFC, others wanted InterDev, and others insisted on firewalls. In some cases the
reason was personal interest, but most times it came from the person's
workplace, or job ads in the newspapers that offered high salaries for certain
knowledge. Although I want to cover many technologies, obviously no one student
will work with all of them, so it is necessary to allow students to be able to
choose some technologies and focus on them.</p>
<p align="left">So, I decided that students will be able to personalize the
course to fit their own taste.</p>
<p align="left">As an important free tip, even if you think you know what
interests you, and want a complete focus on one or two technologies, don't miss
hearing about all the others. The software industry changes rapidly, and a hot
new technology can become literally dead within a year or two - consider CORBA
or even DNA as recent examples. Several students asked the college to
deliver courses on tools that pay very well in the job market now, but will pay
zero in 2-3 years. So don't miss the free opportunity this course offers you to
open your eyes.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The fourth issue </b>to think about was the fact that with so
many technologies to cover, there was no one person that really knew enough
about all of them to lecture on them in depth which is a must in an advanced course.
This is problematic especially since I wanted to provide technical working
knowledge for each surveyed idea - not just the marketing slides from its web
site. To overcome this issue, it was decided that the students themselves will
teach the course; each one will study deeply one or two technologies, and
summarize the material to others. This also enabled the personalization - study,
summarize and lecture on what interests you most. People would be more highly
motivated to study, since they'd be working on subjects they chose (except the
constraint that since we wish to cover &quot;everything&quot;, two groups can't work on the same subjects,
so early choosers will be happier).</p>
<p align="left">So, I decided that pairs (or triplets, if we have to) of students will be lecturing on the
different technologies.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The fifth issue </b>to deal with was the relative lack of
experience of students in preparing and giving lectures. Since the course's
success is based on these lectures, it has a decisive goal to try and improve
students' ability to pass material. To do so, students are required to submit a
time division of their talks as they begin, and prepare a PowerPoint
presentation of their talk, all to ensure thorough planning before the talk.
Feedback will also be given in class for each presentation, in order to improve
the talkers and those that follow them. The presented subjects will also be
summarized in writing on the course's web site, to help people that are better
in writing than speaking. And last but not least, some of the grade will also be
on good presentation, to motivate people to invest more in their performance.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The sixth issue </b>was the need for practical, hands-on
experience in the surveyed tools. Hearing about many technologies and comparing
them is vital, but companies are looking for employees with at least some basic
real life experience today. Two things were done to enable this. First, each
lecture is accompanied by web pages on the course's site, which demonstrate
using the presented tools in code, with detailed explanations. To avoid making
this far too much work for students, it is allowed to provide hyperlinks to
other places on the web that provide these demonstrations (such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com">MSDN
online</a> or <a href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>), if you can find
them.</p>
<p align="left">Secondly, the course had to include a practical programming
project. To continue with the personalization effort, each pair of students will
invent their own project, which must use at least one of the technologies
discussed in the course. Once the project is implemented in code, the students
would know much more about that technology, and will also have something to talk
about in their next job interview.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The seventh issue </b>was the will to prevent this from being
an ordinary course, and turn it into a group learning experience, in which each
one does what he or she likes, and shares it with the others. This meant that
along the lectures the course's web site will contain the studied material,
which will be a useful reference even after the course is over. The site will
also include a knowledge map - a list of who knows what - so that you'll be able
to email each other questions and exchange knowledge during and after the
course. It also meant there there would be no test, since the point of this
course is not to know everything about everything at the end, but knowing well
what you wanted to. Besides, tests don't go well with the concept of information
sharing.</p>
<p align="left"><b>The eighth issue </b>(and last!) to consider was that there
are a lot of students who wish to take this course, and - once I sat down to make
the list - a lot of technologies to cover. If every pair of students lectures,
then there is a limit to the number of students we can handle; big classes
aren't so good anyhow. Also, enough time must be given to present each
technology, otherwise presentations would have to be very shallow.</p>
<p align="left">To overcome this last obstacle, the list of technologies was
divided to two courses. Each one covers four &quot;tracks&quot; - four areas in
the software industry. When dividing the tracks between the courses I tried to
put together topics that are usually used together, and technologies that mix
well with one another. One of the courses is called &quot;Enterprise&quot;, and
it focuses on building very large, distributed, reliable software systems; the
other is called &quot;Development&quot;, and it mostly discusses changes in the
tools, languages and methods used to build software of all kinds is development
nowadays.</p>
<p align="left">I can't recommend which course is better - it depends on your
personal taste and plans. Personally, I intend to learn from both.</p>
