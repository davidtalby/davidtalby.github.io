The Main Lecture&nbsp;</h3>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Students
work in pairs - triplets will be allowed only if too many students enroll. Each
pair must choose one of the 16 main topics offered in their course, and do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Learn
    the subject well, using either books or the web.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Prepare
    a one-hour PowerPoint presentation about the subject, demonstrating how to
    use its most important technical features. The slideshow should also include
    a list of features that exist but were not covered.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Prepare
    a written report in HTML format, describing the key features of the product or technology,
    how it connects to other products, and what competing technologies are
    available.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Either
    find online or create full step-by-step tutorials or demos for using the product.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">The
slideshow, report and demos must be submitted at most two weeks after the
lecture. They are all published on the course's web site for everyone's future
reference. Therefore, you must also write an <code>index.html</code> file as a
cover page to your work. This file should include your names and emails, links
and bibliography about the subject, and links to your presentation, written
summary and demos. Submit your work by emailing a zip file of all relevant
files.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">All the written material - including the slideshow, report and demos
- must be fully in English.</p>

<h3>2. The Short
Lecture</h3>

<p>The topics of the main lectures are on the most widely used technologies in
the software industry; most of them are or will be used by hundreds of thousands
of programmers. The second part of the course shortly presents 16 technologies
that are either too new or too specific to be that widely accepted, but are
still useful and important to know. In each of these last three lectures, five
pairs will present a topic in twenty minutes each.</p>
<p>The available topics are divided to the same tracks as the main ones. In
order to familiarize yourself with as many areas as possible, it is forbidden to
choose a topic from the same track as that of your main lecture.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Each
group must choose one of the 16 short topics, and do the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Learn
    the subject well, using either books or the web.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Prepare
    a twenty minutes PowerPoint presentation about the subject, describing its
    technical features.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Prepare
    a written report in HTML format describing the key features of the product or technology,
    how it connects to other products, and what competing technologies are
    available. The report should be similar in scope to that of the main
    lecture.</li>
  <li>
    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">Either
    find or create full step-by-step tutorials or demos for using the product.
    These should also be similar in scope to those of the main lecture.</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: left; direction: ltr; unicode-bidi: embed">The
slideshow, report and demos must be submitted at most two weeks after the
lecture. They are all published on the course's web site for everyone's future
reference - create an <code>index.html</code> file and submit in the same manner
as in the main lecture. Again, all written material must be in English.</p>

<h3>3. The
Programming Project</h3>

<p>The project's deadline
is the end of the semester. A pair can do a project on any of the technologies
covered in the course, either from the main lecture or the short lectures. Projects
connecting or comparing two technologies will receive a bonus.</p>
<p>You can offer any project that interests you; ideas and guidelines for the
project's size and subject will be given in class. The only limit is that
you must work on a technology from a different track than both your main and
short lectures. This means that you must learn three topics from three different
tracks during the course. Therefore, It would be wise to plan ahead, and choose
your main and short lecture topics based on the topic you're most interest in
gaining hands-on practical experience with.</p>
<p>The projects must be submitted with an HTML page that links to all the source
code and documentation. This page, as well as the entire project's source code, will be
published online as a demonstration for the learned technology, for the benefit
of future students. Once again, everything from the documentation to the HTML
must be fully in English.</p>
