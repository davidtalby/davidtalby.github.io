<h1 align="center">Middleware
Track</h1>

<p align="left">As &quot;Three-Tier&quot; and then &quot;Multi-Tier&quot;
distributed systems burst into the world, a wealth of servers, standards and
services was offered by the big server companies, such as IBM, Sun and
Microsoft. These new standards and services relieved developers from handling
many technical issues such as transactions, cache management, memory management,
security, administration, deployment and others. This track surveys the major
competitors.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Main Lectures of this Track</b></p>

<h3 align="left">1.
CORBA</h3>

<p align="left">given by Yuval Kadosh, Guy Yarden and Aviaz Shtoyer</p>
<p align="left">The Common Object Request Broker Architecture was the first big
industry standard for large-scale middleware. The first part of the lecture
should explain what this actually means: What was the need, what applications is
it good for, who created and implemented the standard, and who uses it today.
The second part should explain the important parts of the CORBA, such as JNDI,
security, dynamic interface discovery and deployment.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">The demos should show two simple yet real-world applications
that takes advantage of CORBA's features.</p>

EJB</h3>

<p align="left">given by Yonatan Tsadik, Dror Cohen and Michael Saban</p>
<p align="left">Enterprise JavaBeans have replaced CORBA as the prime middleware
architecture for the Unix platform, and since it is based on the platform
independent Java, they are successful on Windows and mixed systems as well. This
lectures covers the EJb architecture: Entity beans vs. Sessions beans, defining
transactions, security, deployment and so on.</p>
<p align="left">One of the demons should demonstrate managing transactions and
security using sessions beans alone, and another should do the same with entity
beans.</p>

COM+ = COM + MTS</h3>

<p align="left">given by Vladimir Green and Marina Chernomez</p>
<p align="left">Microsoft's COM+ is the answer to the EJB world, and in exchange
for platform dependence it offers ease of development, speed, cost and close
connectivity to existing Windows applications. This lecture explains what is MTS,
then how COM+ is the combination of COM and MTS, and then shows how COM+
components are developed, used and administered.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="left">One demo should show how to create a COM+ component, deploy it,
and change its properties at runtime from the server. The other demo should show
how COM+ components can have events, and how clients can register for such
events to remain updated.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">4.
dot-NET</h3>
<p align="left">given by Shahar Oz,
Tomer Yatskan and Moti Raz</p>
<p align="left">The .NET slogan is
Microsoft's new vision of 'programming the Internet', and will be included in
all the next versions of its products: Windows, Office, Visual Studio and so on.
This lecture presents the main components of this framework: Web services, SOAP,
WebForms and WinForms, ADO+, CSharp, and also discusses about what this will do
to COM and COM+.</p>
<p align="left">One of the demos should demonstrate the major features of ADO+
(such as XML or translating tables to objects); the other should show how to
create and deploy a web service using CSharp.</p>

<p align="center"><b>Short Lectures of this Track</b></p>
<p align="left">While the main lectures of this track discuss very complex and
highly publicized standards, the short lectures focus on minor services, each
only helping developers with one small problem of building a Multi-Tier
application. Nevertheless, these services are used by most of the thousands of enterprise
projects developed worldwide.</p>

<h3 align="left">1.
Object-Database Connectivity (ODBC)</h3>

<p align="left">given by Cohen Rotem, Cohen Roy and Nir Shani</p>
<p align="left">Microsoft's standard for communicating between databases and COM
objects, usually via ADO objects. Explain what the standard includes, and how
common operations such as queries and updates are programmed
(efficiently).&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">2.
Java-Database Connectivity (JDBC)</h3>

<p align="left">given by Elad Debby &amp; Ronnen Shem-Tov</p>
<p align="left">The Java alternative to ODBC, examples of how it is programmed,
and a short comparison to ODBC.</p>

<h3 align="left">3.
Monitoring and HelpDesk</h3>

<p align="left">given by: <b>Available</b></p>
<p align="left">Compare <i>CA UniCenter</i> and <i>Tivoli</i> as tools to
provide centralized control over the state of distributed applications used by
thousands of users, connected to as many computers and network devices. Choose
one of the tools, and explain what programmers need to add to their programs to
support good monitoring abilities later at runtime.&nbsp;</p>

<h3 align="left">4.
Clustering in Application Servers: WebLogic Server vs. AppCenter</h3>

<p align="left">given by: <b>Available</b></p>
<p align="left">Clustering is the
ability to run several servers in parallel, so that they can share workload and
cover up for one another in case some of them crash. Compare the abilities of <i>Microsoft
AppCenter</i> and <i>WebLogic EJB Server</i> - only relate to the clustering
related features of these products.&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><b>Projects of this Track</b></p>
<p align="left">A project in the middleware track would build a simple yet full
three-tier application, in which each tier will run on a different physical
computer. Projects should include a good object-oriented design of the built
system, and also a simple method of installing and administrating it.</p>
<p align="left">Unfortunately, Hadassah's labs cannot support such projects due
to security constraints - installing and running software on arbitrary computers
in the network might seriously interfere with other students' work. Therefore,
projects in this track are only available to students who can develop and show
it in their workplace.</p>
