8: Learning Unix and C</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Goals</font></h2>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Learn the Unix environment:
        File and directory handling, editing and compiling files,
        first look at makefiles and libraries.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Use central features of the
        C language: Memory allocation and arrays, the
        preprocessor, passing functions as arguments.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Important: Before starting, read
the </font><a href="guidelines.html"><font face="Times New Roman">exercise
guidelines</font></a><font face="Times New Roman"> for this
semester!</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">First Look at Unix</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your best friend in Unix is the <em>man</em>
command. Make sure you are familiar with the following commands (type
&quot;man chmod&quot;, for example):</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font face="Times New Roman"><em>ls, cp, mv, rm, mkdir,
    rmdir, cd, more, head, ps, chmod, finger, who, date</em></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to execute a command in
the background, end the line containing it with a &amp; sign (as
in &quot;emacs &amp;&quot;). Also make sure you can open new
terminals and other programs by clicking the left moue button on
an empty spot on the screen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your programming tools are <em>emacs
</em>- the editor, <em>gcc </em>- the compiler and linker, <em>ddd
</em>- the debugger, and <em>gmake </em>- which aids in
maintainance. Emacs and ddd have help menus which are well worth
a look, while gcc and gmake have man pages.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Take some time to learn the basic
key combinations of Emacs - it will more than pay itself back,
and soon.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31"> The Dynamic Array Library</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You will implement a library that
defines a container data structure, which grows dynamically as
items are added to it but still can be randomly accessed in
constant time complexity. You must use the exact header file we
supply, named </font><a href="libdarray.h"><font
face="Times New Roman">libdarray.h</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman">. It contains the headers of the ten
functions that must be implemented, with documentation on what
each of them should do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You should write a single file
called <u>libdarray.c</u> to implement the library.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The header file contains
preconditions for some of the functions - in this exercise, check
them using the <em>assert(3)</em> function. This means that we
give the responsibility for checking argument correction to the
caller of the library functions. You may also place assertions
anywhere in your code where you feel it to be helpful.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You must implement the library as
an array of pointers. When you need to allocate memory for new
insertions into the array, you are allowed to copy the existing
elements of the array to a new location in memory. See the <em>malloc(3)</em>,
<em>realloc(3)</em> and <em>free(3)</em> about memory allocation.
However, you should not copy the entire array every time a new
element is inserted, since this would be too inefficient;
allocate for future insertions in advance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When removing an element from the
array, say the <em>n</em>'th element, you may copy all elements
that come after it one step backwards in the array. This means
that the n+1'th element will become the n'th element, and next
elements will change places as well. This has the disadvantages
that a removal takes O(n) time and that references into the array
are invalidated after a remove(), but has the advantage of being
easy to implement :-).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Second, when quick-sorting an
array, you are allowed to use the <em>qsort(3)</em> function that
comes with the standard C library, instead of implementing the
algorithm yourself.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Programming-wise, the exercise is
quite short and easy. Most of your time is expected to be taken
on learning the environment, syntax and other technical details.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31"> Testing the Library</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Copy this </font><a
href="Makefile"><font face="Times New Roman">Makefile</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> to the directory in which you are working
(note: Do not copy and paste it from the browser. Use the 'Save
as...' option instead so that tabs won't be converted to spaces).
When running the <em>gmake</em> command, this file will be used.
It contains instructions to look for two files named <u>libdarray.h</u>
and <u>libdarray.c</u> in the current directory, compile them
into an object file named <u>libdarray.o</u> and turning it into
a library named <u>libdarray.a</u>. Running <em>gmake</em> will
print compiler error and warning messages on the screen if any;
if there are no problems, no message will be printed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In order to use the library (for
example, to test it), write a C file with a main() function that
includes libdarray.h and uses the array typedef and functions.
Two such example files are </font><a href="test1.c"><font
face="Times New Roman">test1.c</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> and </font><a href="test2.c"><font
face="Times New Roman">test2.c</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman">. In order to compile and link such a file,
the files libdarray.h and libdarray.a should be in the same
directory with it. To compile test1.c, for example, type:</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman"><code>gcc test1.c -o
    test1 -Wall -ldarray -L.</code></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Remember that Unix is case
sensitive (that is, -o and -O are two different switches). If you'd
like to use the debugger on the resulting executable, add the -g
switch to the gcc command. If there are no errors, this command
should create an executable file named test1 in the current
directory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Solve this exercise alone! If you
rely on others now, you'll have little chance to catch up in
future exercises. However, you are encouraged to share tests you
write with other pairs.</font></p>
