<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Shell
Programs</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This section describes some very basic features of the
Unix shell. The actual exercise description starts in the next section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Read the man pages of the following utilities: <em>ls,
cat, who, ps</em> and <em>echo</em>. All allow you to display some information on the
screen. The output of these programs doesn't have to be sent to the screen right&nbsp;
away: it can be filtered several times. The most common Unix filters are <em>head, tail,
sort, wc, grep, tr, tee</em> and <em>uniq</em>. Take a quick look at their man pages as
well. Filters work as follows: Given a file or a list of files as parameters, they will
process these files; given no parameters, they will process the standard input. This
convention gives great flexibility for combining filters through redirections and pipes: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Counting the number of files that start with the letter
    'a':<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls a* | wc -l</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Print a sorted list of the users currently logged into the
    system into the file 'users':<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who | sort &gt; users</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Check whether the user 'mary' is logged on:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who | grep mary</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Print the ten most popular words in the file 'index.html':<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cat &lt; index.html | tr -sc A-Za-z
    '\012' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail</code></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another nice things the shell gives us is wildcards: </font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">The * character stands for 'any zero or more characters'.
    To print all files in the current directory:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lpr *</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">The ? character stands for 'exactly one character'. The
    following will print information about files named 'c1.doc' or 'cZ.doc' but not 'c10.doc'
    or 'c.doc':<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ls c?.doc</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">The [] pattern stands for exactly one of the characters
    inside the brackets. The following will display the contents of data1, data2 and data7:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cat data[127]<br>
    </code>A range of characters can also be specified. To delete all files that start with a
    letter:<br>
    <code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rm [A-Za-z]*</code></font></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A third nice thing the shell gives us is variables. We
define a variable in a command of the form &quot;var=value&quot;, and from then on the
string $var in commands will be replaced by the string &quot;value&quot;. For example, the
following series of commands will change the directory to /a/b/c/d:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; base =
/a/b<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; below = $base/c<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chdir $below/d</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The shell parses every command it reads to identiry
redirections, pipes, wildcards and variables. The whole process is transparent to the
programs themselves - <em>sort</em>, for example, doesn't know whether its input really
comes from the standard input or from a file, doesn't care whether its output really goes
to the screen, and will never know if the list of input files we sent it originally
contained a wildcard.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">The Program</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Write a program called 'hshell', that acts as a simple
command line interpreter. The program should display a simple prompt in which users can
enter commands, and then parse and execute these commands. The following command formats
must be supported:</font> 

<ol>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Simple commands: <code>program [optional arguments]</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Standard input redirection: <code>program [optionals] &lt;
    in_file</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Standard output redirection: <code>program [optionals] &gt;
    out_file</code> (creates or truncates out_file) and <code>program [optionals] &gt;&gt;
    out_file</code> (creates or appends to out_file).</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Pipelines: <code>program [optionals] | program [optionals]
    | ... | program [optionals]</code></font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Combinations of the above, like: <code>cat &lt; in_file |
    fgrep a | sort &gt; out_file</code>.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Execution of a command in the background: <code>program
    [optionals] &amp;</code></font></li>
</ol>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The hshell program reads commands from the standard input,
just like your usual Unix shell does. For commands that run in the foreground, the shell
waits for the command's completion before starting the next command. When running commands
in the background (i.e. &quot;emacs &amp;&quot;), the shell does not wait for the command
to finish but instead returns to read the next command right away. However, when a process
that was running in the background terminates, the shell should print a line to the
standard error containing the word &quot;Done&quot; and the terminated process id.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Whenever an error is encountered, print a detailed error
message to the standard error (not standard output!), and return to wait for the next
command. The hshell process ends only when it encounters the end-of-file character (type
Ctrl+D at the keyboard for it).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Make sure that commands that change the shell process's
state work as well. Specifically, make sure that the <code>chdir</code> and <code>umask</code>
commands work as usual.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Test your program with the redirection and piping examples
from class and the previous section, and other commands as complex as you can think of.
You are encouraged to share tests (only!!) with other students. Note, however, that some
combinations of redirections and pipes are not legal, for example: &quot;<code>ls &gt;
outfile | sort</code>&quot;&nbsp; or&nbsp; &quot;<code>ls | sort &lt; infile</code>&quot;.
Testing gets easier if you remember that the input and output of the shell itself can be
redirected: You can write a series of tests in a file called &quot;<code>my_tests</code>&quot;
and then run &quot;<code>hshell &lt; my_tests</code>&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Use any parsing method that you like in your program. Note
that the use of white characters (spaces and tabs) is optional but not required around
special characters, so &quot;ls &gt;a &amp;&quot; and &quot;ls &gt;&nbsp; a&amp; and
&quot;ls &gt;a&amp;&quot; are identical.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Bonus</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is one ten points bonus offered for this exercise.
You have to implement shell variables: These are created by typing commands like
&quot;dir=/usr/include/sys&quot; and then using them in other commands like &quot;ls
$dir/*.h&quot;. The dollar sign is a special character that signifies the beginning of a
variable name. You should look for such variables in commands, and replace them with the
values the variables hold.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Each process has a list of variables associated with it -
its &quot;environment table&quot;. This table is a list of strings of the form
&quot;Name=Value&quot;, where 'Name' is the name of the variable. This list is inherited
from parent to child processes, therefore you can't implement it as an internal linked
list in your program. You must use the system's list of variables instead. In order to do
so, you'll have to learn the following functions: <em>putenv, getenv, setenv</em> and <em>unsetenv</em>.
See the man pages for all of them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Having implemented shell variables in this way, your shell
program will already have several variables defined every time it starts running. These
will be variables it inherits from its own parent process, such as PATH, HOME and others.
Commands like &quot;<code>echo $HOME</code>&quot; and &quot;<code>PATH=$PATH:/usr/include</code>&quot;
are examples of simple tests. Also, make sure that your shell can inherit new variables it
defines to its own child processes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This bonus requires you to learn a few functions on your
own, but if done smartly is quite easy.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Miscellaneous</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your submission must include a README, a Makefile, and the
source code of the programs. The Makefile should create eaxctly one executable called
'hshell'. You may include as many source files as you wish. To submit, <u>send an email</u>
to the bodek, containing the full names, id numbers and logins of the submitting pair, and
attach <u>all</u> the relevant files. This time, in contrast to previous exercises, the
files you send will be checked (not the ones in your account), and the time of submittion
(for late submission penalties) will be the time of sending the mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your README file should include a vivid description of how
your program does what it's supposed to. If you choose to implement the bonus, include an
exact description of how you did so in the README. You might lose some of the bonus points
for not being able to describe your accomplishment well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">VERY IMPORTANT: You <u>cannot</u> use any of the following
functions: system(), popen(), pclose() or exececuting the Unix shell as in
execve(&quot;/bin/sh&quot;, ...). Using any of these functions or similar tricks will
result in an automatic grade of zero. You are expected to create child processes using
fork(), manage redirection using open() and dup2(), and handle child termination signals
using signal() and either wait() or waitpid().</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Good luck!</font></p>
