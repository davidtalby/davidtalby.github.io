  <li>int pipe(int filedes[2]);<br>
    </font>Opens two file descriptors: filedes[0] will be open for reading, and filedes[1]
    will be open for writing. Filedes[0] will read what is written into filedes[1]. This is a
    mechanism for inter-process communication between a parent process to its child:<br>
    <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">int n, fd[2];<br>
    pid_t pid;<br>
    char line[1024];<br>
    int main(void)<br>
    {<br>
    if (pipe(fd) &lt; 0)<br>
    { perror(&#147;pipe&#148;); exit(1); }<br>
    if ((pid = fork()) &lt; 0)<br>
    { perror(&#147;fork&#148;); exit(1); }<br>
    else if (pid &gt; 0) {<br>
    close(fd[0]);<br>
    write(fd[1], &#147;hello world\n&#148;, 12);<br>
    while(wait(null) &lt; 0);<br>
    } else {<br>
    close(fd[1]);<br>
    n = read(fd[0], line, 1024);<br>
    write(STDOUT_FILENO, line, n);<br>
    }<br>
    exit(0);<br>
    }</font><br>
    In a production code read() and write() should also be checked for errors.</li>
  <strong><p ALIGN="CENTER">Fifos</p>
  </strong><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int mkfifo(const char *pathname, mode_t mode);<br>
    </font>Creates a file of type fifo, or named pipe. After the file is created, it can be
    accessed using the usual open(), read(), write(), close(), unlink() and so forth.<br>
    Opening a fifo for reading will block until someone else has opened the fifo for writing,
    unless the fifo is opened with the O_NONBLOCK option (in the second argument of the open()
    system call).</li>
  <li>Fifos are similar to pipes but can be used between processes without a parent-child
    relationship. Here is an example of using fifos from the shell. Both prog2 and prog3 need
    the output from prog1, and we don&#146;t want to use a temporary file. So we write:<br>
    <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">mkfifo fifo1<br>
    prog3 &lt; fifo1 &amp;<br>
    prog1 &lt; input_file | tee fifo1 | prog2</li>
  </font><p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
  <strong><p ALIGN="CENTER">Select</p>
  </strong><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int select(int maxfdp1, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds,<br>
    fd_set *execptfds, struct timeval *tvptr);</font><br>
    Waits for an I/O event to occur in one of many file descriptors. You can wait until they
    are ready for reading, ready for writing, or an exception occurred at them. The first
    argument is the maximum number of file descriptors that are in any of the sets plus 1. The
    tvptr argument specifies the maximum time to wait (can be 0.0 seconds as well), or can be
    NULL. If it&#146;s NULL, we wait until one of the descriptors is ready or until we get a
    signal.<br>
    The function returns &#150;1 on error, or the number of ready file descriptors (can be 0
    if we timed out). If the process receives a signal while in select(), the function returns
    with &#150;1 and sets errno to EINTR. Therefore, many times signals are blocked during
    select().</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>struct timeval {<br>
    long tv_sec; /* seconds */<br>
    long_tv_usec; /* microseconds */<br>
    }<br>
    </font>This is the time structure used by select() and many other routines that handle
    time. Most system clocks are accurate to the level of 10-50 microseconds.<br>
  </li>
  <li>FD_ZERO(fd_set *fdset);<br>
    FD_SET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);<br>
    FD_CLR(int fd, fd_set *fdset);<br>
    FD_ISSET(int fd, fd_set *fdset);<br>
    These functions manupulate the &#147;file descriptor set&#148; data type used for three of
    the five arguments of the select system call. They allow initializing, adding to, removing
    from and checking membership of a set.</li>
  <strong><p ALIGN="CENTER">Memory Mapped Files</p>
  </strong><font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>caddr_t mmap(caddr_t addr, size_t len, int prot, int flag,<br>
    int filedes, off_t off);<br>
    </font>Maps a file into memory. &#145;filedes&#146; is the descriptor of the file to map;
    the file must be open, however closing it later will not un-map it. &#145;addr&#146; is
    the address in memory to map to &#150; it is recommended to pass 0 as this argument to let
    the system decide. &#145;off&#146; is the offset in the file from which to map;
    &#145;len&#146; is the number of bytes to map, starting from that offset. &#145;prot&#146;
    is the protection mode for the mapped file &#150; it must match the permissions the file
    was opened with and can be a combination of PROT_READ, PROT_WRITE and PROT_EXEC.<br>
    The function returns the address in which the mapped file is (caddr_t is usually defined
    as char*). If &#145;flag&#146; is MAP_SHARED then store operations will modify the mapped
    file: In other words, writing to this memory will be equivalent to the write() system
    call. If &#145;flag&#146; is MAP_PRIVATE, store operations will work on a copy of the file
    and will not really change it. The function returns (caddr_t)(-1) on error.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int munmap(caddr_t addr, size_t len);</font><br>
    Unmaps a file. This also happens automatically when the process terminates.</li>
  <li>Copying a file using mmap() is much faster than using read() and write(), because there
    is no need to copy buffers from kernel to user space and back during the copy. In order to
    do the copying, follow these steps:<br>
    * Open the source file with open(), then map it with mmap().<br>
    * Create the destination file with open().<br>
    * Read the size of the input file using fstat(), then set the size of the destination file
    to<br>
    that same size using lseek(fdout, src_size-1, SEEK_SET) and write(fdout, &#147;&#148;, 1).<br>
    * Map the destination file with mmap(), with the flag argument MAP_SHARED.<br>
    * Call memcpy(dst, src, src_size) to copy the files by memory-to-memory copy.<br>
    * Either unmap the files or exit the program.</li>
  <li>Memory mapped files can also be used to declare shared memory between processes. The
    special file &#147;/dev/zero&#148; is an infinite stream of zeros when read, and ignores
    anything written to it. Therefore if a parent process memory-maps this file with
    MAP_SHARED and initializes this memory, and then forks, the child processes can use the
    same pointers to write to this shared memory region. The size of the shared memory region
    to create is the second argument of mmap(), and munmap() can be used to free such memory.</li>
  <strong><p ALIGN="CENTER">Sockets</p>
  </strong>
  <li>Sockets allow client/server computing over a large network such as the Internet. There
    are two types of them: Server sockets, which listen passively for requests, and client
    sockets, which initiate the contact with servers. Once a connection is made, both the
    client and the server receive file descriptors and can use the usual read() and write()
    system calls. The connection is full-duplex.<br>
    We will only use the TCP/IP protocol here, since it is the most popular. Servers call
    socket(), bind() and listen() before they can accept() requests; clients just call
    socket() and then they can already connect() to a server.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);</font><br>
    Creates an endpoint for communication and returns a descriptor, or &#150;1 on error. The
    returned descriptor is a &#147;socket descriptor&#148;, not a file descriptor. The domain
    argument is the family of protocols the socket will use: AF_UNIX (internal), AF_INET
    (Internet), and others. The socket has an associated type as well: SOCK_STREAM (connection
    based, fifo and reliable such as TCP), SOCK_DGRAM (datagram based, unordered, unreliable
    such as UDP), SOCK_RAW (simple bytes), SOCK_SEQPACKET and SOCK_DRM. We will use the TCP
    protocol, so: socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0).</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr, int addrlen);</font><br>
    Gives the socket, sockfd, the local address my_addr. my_addr is addrlen bytes long.
    Traditionally, this is called &quot;assigning a name to a socket&quot;. The exact contents
    of struct sockaddr defer between protocols; we use TCP/IP and therefore will use this
    address:<br>
    <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">/* Socket address, internet style. */<br>
    struct sockaddr_in { short sin_family;<br>
    u_short sin_port; struct in_addr sin_addr; char sin_zero[8];}<br>
    </font>Where sin_family is AF_INET, sin_port and in_addr contain the IP address and port
    of the computer to bind to, and sin_zero should just be eight (ignored) zeros. The in_addr
    field holds an IP address; servers should use sockaddr.in_addr.s_addr = INADDR_ANY.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int listen(int s, int backlog);</font><br>
    For a connection based protocol (when the socket type is either SOCK_STREAM or
    SOCK_SEQPACKET), this function declares that the socket is ready to receive requests, and
    also specifies the length of the queue of waiting requests to allocate. The backlog
    parameter is limited to 5 (this is a historical bug).</li>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int connect(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen);</font><br>
    Connects a socket descriptto a remote address. In a client/server program, clients connect
    using the server&#146;s address in order to start a communication. After connect, the
    client can simply use sockfd as a file descriptor in calls to read, write, send and recv.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int accept(int sfd, struct sockaddr *addr, int *addrlen);</font><br>
    Waits until there&#146;s at least one request on the queue for the given socket. Removes a
    connection request from the queue, and returns a file descriptor for that request. That
    file descriptor can be used with read, write, send and recv to communicate with the
    client. The function returns &#150;1 on error; a common error is being interrupted by a
    signal, in which errno will be set to EINTR.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int send(int s, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags);<br>
    int recv(int s, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags);</font>Send and receive data over
    a socket; read and write can be used as well, but these functions have extra power. Both
    functions can have a flag of MSG_OOB to process out-of-band data, and recv can have a flag
    of MSG_PEEK to peek at incoming messages without removing them from the read queue. Flags
    can be combined using &#145;or&#146;.<br>
    The first three arguments are the same as in read() and write(), except that only sockets
    can be used. The functions return the number of bytes read/written or &#150;1 on error.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>int getsockname(int s, struct sockaddr *name, int *namelen);</font><br>
    If &#145;s&#146; is a socket that was bound in the past, this function will write the
    address it was bound to into the &#145;name&#146; and &#145;namelen&#146; arguments.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>unsigned long int htonl(unsigned long int hostlong);<br>
    unsigned short int htons(unsigned short int hostshort);<br>
    unsigned long int ntohl(unsigned long int netlong);<br>
    unsigned short int ntohs(unsigned short int netshort);</font><br>
    Converts integers from the local architecture into network byte order. All integers sent
    over networks should be in this format, and port numbers given to bind(), connect() and
    accept() should be in this order as well. In order of appearance, the functions are host
    to network long (4 bytes), host to network short (2 bytes), network to host long, and
    network to host short. These functions are part of the XDR standard.</li>
  <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">
  <li>struct hostent *gethostbyname(const char *name);<br>
    struct hostent *gethostbyaddr(const char *addr, int len, int type);</font><br>
    Retrieve information about a remote computer using either its name
    (&#147;www.yahoo.com&#148;) or its address (as we have seen, several address types exist).<br>
    The hostent structure is defined in &lt;netdb.h&gt; as follows:<font FACE="Courier New"
    SIZE="2">struct hostent {<br>
    char *h_name; /* official name of host */<br>
    char **h_aliases; /* alias list */<br>
    int h_addrtype; /* host address type, AF_INET at present */<br>
    int h_length /* The length of the address in bytes.<br>
    char **h_addr_list; /* zero-terminated array of hosts&#146; network <br>
    addresses in network byte order. */<br>
    char *h_addr; /* First address in h_addr_list */<br>
    }</li>
  </font>
  <li>When using gethostbyname() or gethostbyaddr(), the variable errno and the function
    perror() won&#146;t work. The two functions will return NULL on error, but in order to
    know which error occurred and to print an appropriate error message, replace errno and
    perror by the following (which do the same):<br>
    <font FACE="Courier New" SIZE="2">extern int h_errno;<br>
    void herror(const char *s);</font><br>
  </li>
