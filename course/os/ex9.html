9: The File System</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Goals</font></h2>

<ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Learn the system calls for
        handling regular files, symbolic links and directories in
        the Unix file system.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Write a program that can
        back up and restore an entire directory tree.</font></li>
</ol>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">The Program</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Compiling your exercise using a
Makefile (that you write) should create two executables named
hbackup and hrestore. The two programs require the following
command arguments:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><code>hbackup &lt;archive_file&gt;
&lt;files_for_backup_list&gt;</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><code>hrestore &lt;archive_file&gt;
&lt;restore_location_base&gt;</code></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The hbackup utility saves into
the archive_file all the files in the files_for_backup_list - a
white-space separated list of files. The archive_file is a
regular file that will contain the backed-up files on success.
The archive file should be created when the program runs; if a
file with the same name already exists, it should not be
overwritten - instead, an error message should be printed and the
program should exit.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Backing up a regular file simply
copies the file data, along with its name and permissions.
Backing up a symbolic link means that we only save the link - not
the file the link points to. Therefore, use <em>readlink(2)</em>
and not <em>read(</em></font><em>2</em><font
face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em> to backup symbolic links, and
use <em>lstat(</em></font><em>2</em><font face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em>
to determine file types. Backing up a directory means backing up
the directory itself (name and permissions), including <strong>all</strong>
the files in it <strong>recursively</strong>. If you encounter a
file of another type (such as a socket, pipe or device) print an
error message saying that it can't be backed up, and continue to
the next file (this is a non-fatal error, see below).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The hrestore utility is used to
restore files from an archive. To make life simpler, you only
have to implement restoring an entire archive, and not parts of
it. The program takes exactly two arguments: The name of an
archive file in which there are backed up files, and the name of
a directory. All files in the archive file should be recreated on
this directory. If a directory was backed up, it should be
recreated as a sub-directory of the restore_location_base. Files
should be restored with their original names and access
permissions.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Both hbackup and hrestore should
give an indication of progress: On completing a file read or
write, both programs should print a line to the standard output
containing the full name of the file and its size. See the output
example in the next section. </font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Error Handling</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Error handling should be done as
follows. You must check all system call return values and every
other possibility of failure, and report each error by printing
an informative message to the screen. Use the <em>perror(</em></font><em>3</em><font
face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em> function for printing system
error messages. An example of proper error handling and the use
of <em>perror(</em></font><em>3</em><font face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em>
is in both example files, in the 'Help' section.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two types of errors in
this exercise: Fatal and non-fatal ones. Fatal errors prevent you
from continuing to backup or restore: Wrong arguments, inability
to access the archive file, and so forth. Non-fatal errors are an
inability to read or write one file on the way (because of
permissions or a special file type, for example). On a <strong>fatal</strong>
error, print an error message and <strong>terminate</strong> the
program with an exit code of 1. On a <strong>non-fatal</strong>
error while working on a file, print an error message starting
with the file name (see 'access denied' example in the previous
section), and <strong>continue</strong> working to the next file
as if nothing happened. All error messages must be sent to
standard error, and not standard output - the example programs
demonstrate this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">This is an example of running the
programs. We create an archive file called 'backupex9' that
should contain a regular file called 'reg_file' and the directory
'ex9', all from the current directory:</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">&gt; hbackup backupex9 reg_file
ex9<br>
ex9 4096<br>
ex9/hbackup.c 7758<br>
ex9/hrestore.c 6494<br>
ex9/test.c: Access denied<br>
ex9/README 1490<br>
ex9/test 4096<br>
ext/test/my_data 45912<br>
&gt; hrestore backupex10 ~<br>
open: No such file or directory<br>
&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">For each file that is
successfully saved, its name and size and printed to the standard
output. On error (such as with 'ex9/test.c'), the file name
followed by a colon and the system's error message are printed to
the standard error. However, this is a non-fatal error, so we
move on to the next file. Note that we backup all of the ex9
directory, and move recursively into the 'ex9/test' directory as
well. The program exits with an exit code 0. On the other hand,
hrestore is called with an archive file that doesn't exist, which
is a fatal error. An error message is printed, and the program
terminates with an exit code 1. Note that some of these
instructions contrast those in the exercise guidelines - when in
question, follow the instructions here.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Bonus</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There are two bonuses offered for
this exercise. Implementing both can give you a maximum grade of
120.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A ten points bonus will be given
for including an integrity check in the archive file. The hbackup
program should place some signature of each archived file along
with its other data, and when the file is restored this signature
will be checked. If the archive file has been damaged or changed,
the program should report the error (as a non-fatal error). To
get the bonus, invent a signature scheme and add it to both the
backup and restore programs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Another ten points bonus will be
given for correctly handling the issue multiple hard links to the
same file. It is possible that two different regular files that
you back up will be two hard links to the same i-node. In this
case it is of course only necessary to save the file data once,
and let both hard links point to it. In restoring, the data
should be written to disk only once as well. You are allowed to
ignore this issue and back up every file, but if you do handle it
and get it right, the bonus is yours. The i-node number a file
name refers to is returned by the </font><em>lstat(2)</em><font
face="Times New Roman"> system call.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Miscellaneous</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your submission must include a
README, a Makefile, and the source code of the programs. See the
exercise guidelines about README and make files. You may include
as many source files as you wish. To submit, place all files in a
directory called &quot;~/os/ex9&quot;. Copying all these files to
a new directory and running 'make' should create exactly two
executables - hbackup and hrestore.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">You can save some coding if you
place functions that both programs use in a common header/source
file pair, and then #include the header file to use it. You are
expected to do a smart job of design - duplicate code, unreadable
C tricks and not using constants, for example, can hurt your
grade just as badly as a runtime bug. Not to mention not checking
return values or ignoring them.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Since this is the first Makefile
you submit, it will be checked as well. A good make file will
cause 'make' to compile <strong>only</strong><em> </em>the
necessary files when a file changes. In order to test your make
file, you can use the 'touch' utility (see 'man touch'). Touching
a file does not change it, but changes its last modification date
so that it seems modified. The Makefile for this exercise is a
simple variation of what we've done in class.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If you choose to implement the
bonus, include an exact description of the algorithm(s) you used
in the README file. You might lose some of the bonus points for
not being able to describe your accomplishment well.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32"
height="31">Help</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The following two programs
demonstrate some of the systems calls you'll need. Most of their
code has cut-and-paste value to you. They also demonstrate how to
deal with both system and non-system error messages, and give a
general idea of the style and amount of documentation required.
Smaller issues such as reading command-line arguments and using <em>printf(</em></font><em>3</em><font
face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em> and <em>fprintf(</em></font><em>3</em><font
face="Times New Roman"><em>)</em> are also shown.</font></p>

<p><a href="file_copy.c"><font face="Times New Roman">file_copy.c</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> - This program copies a regular file to a
new file name. Shows how to use <em>open</em>, <em>read</em>, <em>write</em>
and <em>close</em>.</font></p>

<p><a href="list_dir.c"><font face="Times New Roman">list_dir.c</font></a><font
face="Times New Roman"> - This file prints the name, size and
type for each file in a given directory. Shows how to use <em>opendir</em>,
<em>readdir</em>, <em>closedir</em> and <em>lstat</em>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Before beginning to write
anything, make sure to read the man page of every system call you
use - we cannot and have not covered every tiny detail in class.
Remember that system calls are in section 2 of the man pages, so
you need to write 'man 2 open' or 'man 2 lstat' to read them.</font></p>
