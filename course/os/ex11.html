<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Goals</font></h2>

<ol>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Learn client-server programming using TCP sockets.</font></li>
  <li><font face="Times New Roman">Write a stateless FTP server for regular files.</font></li>
</ol>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">The Program</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Write a program called 'hftp', implementing a stateless
file server. The command-line usage for running the server is:</font></p>

<p><font face="Courier">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hftp &lt;port-number&gt;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Do not write a client program that interacts with the
server; instead, you should write a library that lets others write a client program that
suites them best. The library should implement the header file <a href="hftp.h">hftp.h</a>,
and be called 'libhftp.a' when compiled. You should also submit a Makefile, which, when
executed, creates exactly two files named 'hftp' and 'libhftp.a' from the source files in
the current directory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">As the client header file suggests, a client starts by
calling hftp_open() and should end its connection with the server by calling hftp_close().
Over an open connection, it is possible to send and receive files, rename a remote file or
move it between directories, change the remote directory we are in and get a short or long
listing of the files in the current remote directory. A client process can only have one
open connection to the server at any time, but it can close an open connection and reopen
a different one if necessary. The connection between the client and the server should be
implemented using TCP/IP sockets.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The server must be able to handle multiple clients at
once; this should be done by forking a new process to handle every new connection.
However, in order to avoid an overload, the server should never agree to have more than 10
open clients at once. Since the server is multi-process, calls to wait() and handle of
SIGCHLD must be taken care of. This has at least two consequences on the program. First,
the accept() and other system calls can be interrupted by a signal, in which case the
system call will return -1 and set errno to EINTR. Remember that this case is not an
error. Second, you might need to block signals (SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE) in some parts of the
program, in order to avoid critical sections. This is not required in all implementations,
but make sure if and where your code needs it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">When a client connects, it connects to a default directory
on the server - the directory the server was started from. This is considered the current
remote working directory for this connection, which means the file names the client refers
to will be relative to that directory. The client can also change this directory using the
hftp_cwd() function. Note that the server can have different &quot;current
directories&quot; for the different connections it currently holds open.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">In case of errors, the server program should print
detailed error messages to the standard error, and return to accepting new connections.
The server should never terminate due to an error; it can only be terminated by explicitly
killing it from the shell that started it (see the man pages of the &quot;jobs&quot;,
&quot;ps&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; shell commands).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The client library must <u>never</u> write anything to the
screen, including error messages. All the library functions return an integer, which
should be zero on success and -1 on error. The specific error code of the last library
function call is saved in the variable hftp_errno. This variable must be updated after
every library function call, whether it was successful or not. The code 0 (zero) is saved
for success, and you may define other error codes as you wish. The function hftp_error()
works just like perror(), but for library errors; it also resets the hftp_errno variable
to zero. Remember to write to the standard error and not the standard output.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Some of the errors will be caused by improper use of the
library - getting or putting a file on a closed connection, giving NULL as a file name
parameter, refusal of the server to open a connection due to overload, and so forth. But
many errors will be file errors - file not found, access denied, file of unsupported type
and others you recall from ex9. For this kind of errors, the easiest implementation of
hftp_error() will be to call perror(). For the previous kind of errors, you need to write
your own detailed error messages.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Bonus</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">There is one ten points bonus for this exercise: Extend
the server to support the transfer of entire directories as well. If the file type of the
arguments passed to hftp_putfile() or hftp_getfile() is a directory, then the entire
directory and everything inside it - recursively, as in ex9 - is transferred. Symbolic
links are still handled differently that in ex9 - we don't send or receive the links
themselves, but the files the link point to.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The bonus is not hard to write - when having to transfer a
directory tree, pack it using your ex9 code on one side, send it as one regular file, and
unpack it again on the other side. Assuming your packing and unpacking code works
correctly, all you need to do is change the treatment of symbolic links and then
cut&amp;paste.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">A wise way to do that will be to insert your ex9 code into
a library as well - a library that can pack a file, a symbolic link or a directory tree
into a new regular file, and then unpack it. It's the right thing to do from a software
engineering point of view, and it will make the code easier to reuse if you will need it
for next year's project.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="accent.gif" width="32" height="31">Miscellaneous</font></h2>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your submission must include a README, a Makefile, and the
source code of the programs. The Makefile should create exactly one executable called 'hftp'
and one library called 'libhftp.a'. You may include as many source files as you wish. To
submit, <u>send an email</u> to the bodek, containing the full names, id numbers and
logins of the submitting pair, and attach <u>all</u> the relevant files. Do not attach
'hftp.h' - we will check the exercise using the published version, not any modification
you wrote. Remember that the files you send will be checked (not the ones in your
account), and the time of submission (for late submission penalties) will be the time of
sending the mail.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Your README file should include a vivid description of how
your program does what it's supposed to. If you choose to implement the bonus, include an
exact description of how you did so in the README. You might lose some of the bonus points
for not being able to describe your accomplishment well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Start working from the example <a href="client.c">client.c</a>
and <a href="server.c">server.c</a> files from class. Use your code from ex9 for reading
and writing files (although you'll need to change it since this time we treat symbolic
links differently). A simple way to write the hftp_ls() and hftp_dir() functions is to
call the real &quot;ls&quot; program using fork, exec and wait.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Good luck!</font></p>
